  Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is
  advised. Hello! Bonjour. You sounded like brad pitt in

  inglorious bastards. Haven't seen it.

  You just sounded super american

  saying bonjour.

  I uh thought that the password for this

  meeting was come

  20. Come 20,

  slogan for the year isn't it.

  When i tried to log out they were like

  how satisfied are you with your

  experiences?

  Zero doesn't exist so I'm going to take a

  one.

  I left a similar review on the lego

  website.

  Why? It was this big secretive

  release,

  so they're releasing a new set

  at the end of this month, so their email

  was like oh click on this link

  and subscribe to our mailing list to be

  one of the first people to find out what

  this secret set is,

  and then lower down it was like VIP

  members can view a video from the actors

  who played fred and george weasley who

  do a Q & A

  with the creators of this kit to test

  their knowledge on harry potter.

  I was like yeah that'll pass 10 minutes

  let's do that.

  Link didn't work, couldn't get through to the VIP section,

  the pages were really slow, and then as I

  was scrolling through

  just browsing the lego, a pop-up came up

  and was like "how has your visit been

  today".

  I was like, well all right, pages are slow,

  your hyperlinks don't work,

  videos nowhere to be found, you wouldn't

  let me into the VIP

  section, you wouldn't let me into my

  account,

  very dissatisfied. How old are you? Over

  18.

  Of course. That was the oldest age group.

  They were like zero to five,

  six to ten, ten to fifteen,

  sixteen to eighteen, over eighteen.

  Oh that's funny. I've seen

  a a leak of what the set is. What is it?

  A full scale diagon alley,

  and it looks amazing.

  Oh my god, that's amazing! Yeah,

  so even though the website on my

  face,

  I'm still gonna buy it.

  You know why I suggested that we would

  watch

  logan next time we're hanging out?

  Because you know that I

  enjoy a muscular man and

  hugh jackman buffs up very nicely.

  He does, he does, but also because the

  little girl in that movie is the girl

  that played

  the lead role in his dark materials.

  Oh the one that you hated, the one that

  you

  absolutely abhorred. I didn't,

  I just said.... the one that you were

  physically sick

  watching because her acting was so bad.

  You always take whatever I say to the

  absolute extreme. Do you want to

  know the word for that?

  Yeah I probably know it already, tell me anyway.

  Hyperbolise. You always hyperbolise

  everything I say. Oh hyperbolize, I like that.

  Because when I said that [censored] was an

  attractive woman you were like you hyped

  her up

  so much, you were like she's a goddess. I

  was like

  never said that, said she was an attractive woman. Because it's funny to wind you up. If you

  haven't worked out that that's how our

  friendship

  dynamic works by now,

  I feel like you haven't been paying

  attention to any of our conversations.

  Do you feel like you can't do

  all of your funnies because I don't get

  annoyed?

  Sometimes there is not the

  back and forth banter that I would

  appreciate

  if you were getting annoyed.

  But that doesn't stop me from trying.

  You're lucky I don't get annoyed.

  No I am, because

  otherwise we would not have lasted as

  long as we have.

  Most people by now have been like you're

  a cunt, why do i even talk to you. Probably.

  Wow okay. You funny cunt, don't get me wrong.

  You little...

  Oh but you do like the inflammatory

  comments.

  I'll inflame your comments.

  Hashtag come 20.

  Okay are you ready for the case?

  Are we ready to talk about crime. What?

  Do you feel stressed? Yeah, hey my dudes...

  Do you have like other things that you need

  to do? I've got fuck

  all going on mate. Then why are you

  stressing me?

  Because it's funny.

  Is it though? Yes.

  Oh god. You're listening to

  midweek murders, I'm your host... No,

  which means, wait. Ah she it fucked it.

  Why don't you do it this week. Hello

  it's a wednesday, and that means it's time

  to talk about crime,

  with midweek murders.

  I'm your host Joe. 

  And I'm your host Sandra, but let's do it

  properly this time.

  And this week we're coming from

  Upplands Vasby.

  We're coming from the swedish chef. 

  Herding gird,

  chocolate moose. You're listening to

  midweek murders,

  which means that it's time to talk about

  crime.

  I'm your host sandra. And I'm your

  co-host

  Joe. Ba bam. This week

  we're going to talk about the case of

  the ice valley

  woman, or as it is in norwegian

  the Isdal woman, that means

  ice valley if you didn't know.

  I'm here to wow you with my scandinavian

  prowess.

  You're welcome. My scandinave prowess.

  And I got my sources, my

  information,

  from wikipedia, death in ice valley

  the podcast by Marit

  Higraff and Neil McCarthy. McCarthy,

  McCarthy. Sorry, should I say that again?

  Yeah I don't think you managed to get

  that out in one go.

  The podcast death in ice valley

  by Marit Higraff and Neil McCarthy,

  and a video that was from

  buzzfeed unsolved, researched by

  Christopher Hodspeth,

  Ryan Bergara and Shane Maday.

  I also got mine from wikipedia, a bbc

  article,

  and also the buzzfeed video.

  Okay so our case starts on the

  29th of november 1970,

  when a man and his two daughters were

  out on a hike in an area called

  ice valley, or Isdalen as i said.

  As one of the girls noted the smell of

  burnt flesh

  she decided to investigate, and found the

  charred

  body of a woman laying on her back

  with her arms up in a boxing position, a

  common pose in which people have

  died in fires are found in. Is this true?

  This is actually the first i've heard of

  it, so

  no comment. No comment. What do I look like,

  some kind of pathologist?

  Yes question mark? Joke's on you they're

  medically trained.

  Shocked by what they had stumbled upon,

  they

  immediately notified the police.

  At the crime scene police noticed

  several

  confounding details, such as the labels

  being cut off the woman's clothing,

  the woman's back being untouched by

  the flames, as well as her jewelry and

  watch having been removed

  from her body before the fire but not

  taken. There was also a fur hat

  underneath the body which contain traces

  of petrol. At the autopsy

  they discovered 50 to 70 sleeping

  pills in her stomach, bruising on the

  right side of her neck, and

  soot in her lungs indicating that she had

  been alive

  whilst on fire. They concluded that the

  cause of death

  was a combination of the medication in

  her system

  as well as the carbon monoxide poisoning.

  Is this like, because one

  of the policemen said

  that she hadn't swallowed all of the

  pills,

  does that mean that she did have some of

  the pills in her

  mouth? Or did... It probably means that

  there were more pills found

  outside of her person, either in a bottle

  or surrounding area. Okay. I think

  he might have meant, because he was

  norwegian, he was one of the policemen

  on the scene. I think he might have meant

  that it wasn't

  digested. Most of them weren't digested,

  that's how they found them, in her

  stomach.

  Yeah, okay, makes sense. So they found

  50 to 70 in her stomach,

  but she could have taken a hundred.

  Okay so if we're speculating,

  then most of the pills that she took

  had not hit her system at the time of

  death.

  Well we don't know how many she took, but

  I would assume that she hadn't.

  Because anybody who's taking more than

  50 to 70

  is crazy.

  Did you research the like the brand

  fenemal? I researched it, and it said that

  it was

  most commonly used nowadays I guess,

  as a epilepsy medicine.

  But back then it could have been

  probably sleeping pills or anxiety...

  So they're phenobarbitol which is a

  barbiturate

  so i would have assumed they were used

  as a sleeping pill and i think that's

  what fenimo was

  prescribed as it's definitely not

  prescribed in the uk

  as i don't think it's prescribed at all

  in the uk actually

  but i don't know okay is it because it

  has

  too many side effects or usually because

  barbiturates aren't prescribed in the uk

  that much anymore

  so for example the lethal cocktails that

  they give

  to people on death row in the u.s

  contain barbiturates

  which basically just stop your heart

  rate

  if it's a high enough dose so they're

  usually considered too dangerous okay

  that makes sense this was as i said in

  the 70s so

  the rules and the regulations might have

  been different because in

  scandinavian countries in general they

  don't prescribe

  medicines that can have any kind of

  dangerous side effects like they're very

  never mind yeah but given that her um

  prescription had been erased from the

  bottle

  there's no way to tell in what country

  or by what doctor they were prescribed

  so given that in scandinavia they don't

  prescribe

  drugs that have a high risk of side

  effects it's likely that she didn't get

  them from there in the first place

  okay three days after the body had been

  discovered

  two suitcases were found by police at

  the bergen

  railway station and bergen i

  just wanted to tell you that just

  literally means

  mountains very similar to germany

  yeah they could link these the suitcases

  to the body of the woman because of a

  fingerprint lifted off

  of a pair of sunglasses found in one of

  the suitcases

  in addition to the sunglasses they found

  maps

  several different currencies wigs

  a pair of non-prescription classes

  and a notebook with coded

  notes i guess as well as normal things

  such as clothes and makeup

  what was not normal was that it kind of

  seemed like she had

  rubbed off the fingerprints of

  everything else

  except for these one pair of sunglasses

  which had like a partial

  fingerprint and that she had rubbed off

  like the labels

  of the cosmetics so creams

  and makeup and stuff she had rubbed off

  the labels of those

  so in the suitcases i don't know which

  one

  they also found a tube of

  eczema cream with a prescription

  label where she had dropped off the

  doctor's name

  and also her own name the police

  concluded

  that the last time the woman had been

  spotted was a week

  before her body was found or six days

  i think and she was checking out

  of a hotel in norway

  the staff at the hotel described the

  woman as non-talkative

  with the strange english accent

  like all of them said that her english

  wasn't that good and also

  with a possible lisp so they couldn't

  tell

  if like her accent was strong because

  she

  couldn't really speak english or if it

  was because

  she had a lisp and a noticeable

  like gap between her two front teeth

  which i'm not sure is does that cause a

  lisp

  i'm not sure it does i don't think it

  causes a lisp but it's quite an

  identifiable feature

  so a bell boy at the hotel where she was

  last spotted

  asked her where she was from because

  he found her accent a bit

  unusual and she had told him that she

  was from belgium

  other things they noted was that she had

  gold

  teeth which was not common

  in the 1970s in norway at all

  and that she smelled strongly of

  something

  possibly garlic and this is

  differing depending on which witness

  you ask a lot of people noticed

  that she had a very pugnant

  smell which was

  pungent smells sorry which was not

  cohesive with the way that she was

  dressed

  she was a very very elegant lady

  and all of the norwegians

  definitely weren't used to people

  coming to visit as tourists

  and when they did they weren't

  clad in the like very fashionable

  clothing and they weren't like they did

  notice her everyone noticed her i also

  read somewhere

  that one of the hoteliers said that she

  smelled quite distinctly and it took him

  like a year to be able to identify that

  smell

  as garlic yeah and the reason it took

  him that long was because

  garlic wasn't very popular in the 70s

  in norway like i don't know how

  reputable that

  is in scandinavia i would say that

  people didn't eat much garlic in the 70s

  like now good job you weren't born then

  because i eat garlic

  for everything and i'm not sure

  that it was garlic because it was a

  shoe shop man that said

  that it was garlic probably okay

  yeah some of the ladies like some of

  hotel staff and maids and

  stuff like that said that there was some

  kind of

  very strong herbal

  kind of scent they weren't sure

  what it was but it could have been

  garlic or it could have been

  something else like a perfume that was

  very

  strong i guess i don't think they thank

  you

  yeah and because she was so well dressed

  and all of the people who met her

  assumed that she had a lot of money

  i think they noticed the smell because

  it was pugnant or what did you say

  pungent pungent yeah so it was a very

  strong smell

  and they didn't like it nobody liked it

  so it was weird and some people

  on the internet or on reddit

  said that it might have been an eczema

  cream

  like some kind of skin cream

  that was smelly rather than garlic

  or a perfume because she probably

  wouldn't have

  chosen it herself and also

  if you smell that strongly of garlic

  you have to eat loads of garlic

  like

  i eat garlic probably with a meal a day

  i don't smell that badly of garlic i

  don't think right

  not at all no

  but if you've met me you wouldn't say

  that i

  smelled strongly of garlic right no

  totally not

  stop it say it properly for the audience

  please

  i think she was a vampire hunter

  case closed yeah got killed by a vampire

  sure sure but no i think that

  nobody can eat that much garlic you know

  what i mean

  challenge accepted

  so i don't think it was garlic but maybe

  after that the police began tracing her

  movements before

  her death with the help of her notepad

  entries

  that seemed to list dates and places

  where the istal woman had been

  and side note her notepad

  entries was in a code but

  because of her handwriting

  they could match her notepad entries

  with places

  because when they kind of cracked the

  code

  as it were they noticed that

  she had been around norway

  in a lot of different places and she had

  written

  her name and passport number and

  everything

  like that in their check-in forms

  because in the 70s as a tourist you had

  to write your

  name and passport number and country of

  birth and stuff like that with the help

  of handwriting

  analysis they compared her notes

  in the notebook with check-in forms

  and that they concluded that the woman

  had traveled around norway

  in oslo torontimes

  stavanger and europe so

  some of the places was in sweden and

  paris

  etc during her travels she had used at

  least

  eight different passports and she had

  also used different names at all of the

  places

  stating that she was from belgium most

  commonly

  whilst filling out the forms in either

  german

  or french and

  the woman that did the podcast marit

  she speaks german fluently and she said

  that

  some of the check-in forms

  was not grammatically accurate

  in german so she probably couldn't

  speak german fluently

  she didn't seem like a native german

  because she couldn't properly write out

  an occupation in german grammatically

  correct

  in german didn't the most recent

  evidence of her

  teeth show that she grew up in germany

  no it showed that she was born in

  germany

  and then moved to

  either the german french border so she

  would still know german

  well she could have been in a french

  school she was french tour

  because they found that from a

  handwriting analysis

  yeah but she didn't seem to be 100

  fluent in german that's what they

  kind of are guessing from the way that

  she wrote down her occupation

  well eyewitness statements say

  that they think which is also

  like most norwegian didn't nor

  morse what what mostly

  morse most

  from the top most people in norway

  didn't speak german or french

  in the 1970s so they

  thought that she might have spoken

  to other people that she met other men

  that she was with in different hotels

  and shops

  in either german french or flemish

  they're not quite sure so that's kind of

  still a mystery i guess the police

  ruled the death of suicide

  but many of the norwegian police

  say that they find this

  quite unbelievable not only because of

  the

  location of the body which was in a

  hiking trail that is not generally

  very easy to get to like it's

  it's a very hard hike

  she didn't have the clothes for a hike

  and going up there to commit suicide

  it's a very hard track and also

  like why you could have committed

  suicide anywhere

  you know in the podcast

  death in ice valley they kind of allude

  to the fact that she

  could have been born before world war

  ii and therefore been able to

  escape nazi germany

  because of the kinder

  transport so they think that she

  might have been born before the war and

  then before the war

  broke out she was moved from her family

  to another country maybe

  they still don't know but i would say

  if she was a spy which it kind of

  points towards that because of the

  notepad with the coded messages

  and the fact that she didn't put down

  her real name she had a lot of different

  passports

  etc etc it kind of points to the fact

  that

  maybe she was a spy because they

  couldn't find

  any record of her in any of these

  countries

  that her like the names on the passport

  were not real people there was no

  trail i guess but to counter that

  do spies not

  get given a counter personality

  that has a full background yeah for them

  to fall under so if she were given

  another name would that name not have

  a job and a birth location and a

  passport and a birth certificate

  and all of these things that she was

  missing to

  like give her a false identity of being

  someone completely

  non-suspicious yeah they did

  interview on the podcast from bbc and

  nrk they did interview a former kgb

  agent that had the exact same point

  that you had he was like if she was a

  kgb agent

  which he wouldn't have been because of

  the fact that they get given

  a person who has died that already has

  a history and a first name

  and a job that kind of stuff and she

  wouldn't have had eight different

  passports

  because that's not what they did in the

  kgb

  yeah it just it seems strange to and i

  i mean i've got no knowledge of

  the spy networks and how they actually

  run

  but it seems a bit strange that she

  would be given

  eight different identities that just

  stop with the name that doesn't seem to

  hold up

  under any kind of script that that's

  almost

  as suspicious as just

  sticking to your original name it

  definitely is

  and that was his point as well

  and he said he she is definitely not

  a kgb agent because if she was

  they would have given her one name and

  one birthplace

  and one history like one

  job you know yeah

  easier to remember yeah and uh

  questioning

  or torture or whatever yeah but he also

  said

  that what it looks like is that

  she might have been a courier which

  means that she might have taken

  information

  from one place to another or from one

  person to another

  because she moved around in norway a lot

  for example and he said that but

  if she was a courier which he could have

  been

  she wasn't a kgb agent courier

  she was some other secret agent

  career and that brings

  i don't think should be mi6 either

  no or mi5 whichever one deals with

  non-uk affairs fun fact for you

  one of them deals with internal affairs

  one of them deals with international

  affairs that's the difference

  is that the difference is mi5 internal

  and am i can't remember which way is but

  one of them deals with spy affairs

  in based in the uk or great britain

  and the other one deals with

  international obviously still working

  for

  the uk i think mi5 is

  national i think mi5 is probably yeah

  the national one then six is the

  international

  i think so but i should say also that

  the history at the time

  in the 1970s was that they

  were involved in the cold war so

  norway is not a part of

  eu but is a part of nato

  so they're aligned with america

  and they were as well in the 1970s

  and the journalist in the podcast that i

  listened to

  she grew up close to one of norway's

  largest military bases

  so they had a lot of american soldiers

  come

  there to they were sent to norway to

  train

  in arctic environments because of the

  cold it's cold and it rains all

  the time

  health creek it's

  pretty though it's so pretty but

  it rains

  all the time and it gets really cold

  cult creek

  so at the time they were testing

  the penguin missiles

  in norway which was a new kind of

  weapon and she was spotted

  several times this is an air quote

  because obviously we don't trust

  eyewitness statements

  that much i guess but she was spotted by

  a fisherman

  that lived and worked very close to

  where the missile

  tests were conducted

  he claimed that he saw her

  at the time and several times

  when those missiles were tested

  and he said that he saw her talking to a

  norwegian

  naval officer at the time so

  he was obviously connected to the

  testing

  and because they were afraid of russian

  invasion at the time probably still are

  if my parents are anything to go by

  she called he called the police and said

  that this

  woman that is noticeably

  not norwegian because every eyewitness

  that

  saw her said that she's not norwegian

  they could tell because there wasn't a

  lot of tourism in

  norway and she dressed very upscale

  whale

  way which they didn't in norway they

  were mostly in you know

  outdoor blushes yeah and also because it

  rained so much

  probably wellies you know all the time

  don't need wellies if you're wearing

  galoshes

  noticeably not norwegian she had a tan

  she had a tan therefore she can't be

  norwegian

  probably quite accurate but i was still

  talking about the fisherman

  he said that she had spoken to a naval

  officer a norwegian naval officer so he

  called the police because he was scared

  of russia i was like yeah this woman

  keeps popping up

  during these penguin missile tests and

  i'm not sure if she's a russian spiral

  and that report is on record

  with the norwegian secret service

  but the interview itself is deleted

  so it can't be found classified

  yeah or it doesn't exist because they

  did

  release the reports after x amount of

  years

  but the report itself is

  on record but the actual interview with

  him

  which is also on record that they did an

  interview with him

  is also deleted so the tapes

  is nowhere to be found and the

  fisherman's son

  that they interviewed in the podcast

  says

  that his father was approached by the

  norwegian secret service give it a gun

  and they told him to off to england

  i don't i'm not sure if that's

  actually true because it's his son

  that is saying that they were like they

  gave him a gun and said like

  use this to protect yourself

  and then off please hmm

  doesn't sound like something that any

  kind of security service

  would do yeah no it doesn't but also

  on the live episode of that podcast

  they interviewed like the police

  one of the higher ups in the

  norwegian police force and they were

  like

  could this be a hit by the

  norwegian secret service he was like no

  way because if they had murdered her

  her body would not have been found yeah

  fair enough and i was like wow

  confident in his team i like it no he

  was like no

  no way because if they had

  murdered her yeah he's confident that

  his team would have done a good enough

  job to have

  properly covered it up no the norwegian

  secret service is not

  the norwegian police it's too separate

  yeah

  but what he's saying is if it were the

  secret service in norway they would have

  done a good enough job to not leave any

  evidence

  yeah that's that's what he's saying

  it was like no way i like i think that's

  commendable

  he was like especially not in norway

  they wouldn't have left the body

  in norway no way no take her to finland

  let the potato breathers deal with her

  you know finland is actually like the

  happiest and most successful country in

  all of europe

  yeah because they're always drunk they

  also have the highest

  rate of alcohol consumption in all of

  europe

  no then those two together denmark

  oh it's the same place

  in finland they have socialism maybe

  you'll cut the potato breathing part

  don't want to offend us candy listener

  base

  they're doing very well obviously

  because yeah finland is the best country

  in the world i love them

  no go finland that's good night

  good night bye

  is do not cover it says that

  on all of our radiators in sweden

  in finnish yeah iso

  why in finnish i don't know maybe

  they're manufactured in finland

  i don't know oh maybe that's why they're

  so happy they're so warm

  well at least we do isolate our

  buildings

  at least we isolate our buildings you

  building step away

  we don't have any neighbors that's why

  put the weapon down building

  you're going to the gulag yeah like the

  closest neighbor is like 40 miles away

  i'm moving to finland sounds

  amazing

  socialism radiators

  no neighbours no wonder they're so

  happy

  nobody like norway is so

  prosperous so pretty so prosperous

  because they have oil and they are so

  saudi arabia oh wait yeah

  that's the difference and then you said

  socialism

  just sorry bruh okay so

  kettle key probably pronounced another

  way

  which i should do

  that expression

  a norwegian man who'd been out for a

  hike in the 1970s

  claims that he met the israel woman on

  his way back to bergen

  which is one he said that it was on a

  sunday

  and her body was found on a sunday so he

  couldn't have been on the same day he

  said that it was an

  in an afternoon and the body was found

  in the morning

  so he would have known

  that he couldn't have seen her on the

  same day that her body was found

  you know i've been a different sunday

  that's the thing

  it could have been the sunday before

  but she was last spotted checking out of

  the hotel

  on a monday or it could have been

  several sundays before i'm not sure

  but that kind of leads me

  into believing a statement because it

  doesn't fit in the timeline

  of the crime your statement makes

  no sense i believe you

  well i kind of feel like it does lean

  to more plausible

  so when was she found she was found on a

  sunday morning

  that when on the 29th of

  november 1970

  okay because in her diary she was in

  bergen

  on the 24th

  of march and then she was in stevena

  on the 29th of october

  and then also the 9th until the 18th

  of november so it's perfectly possible

  that he's seen her

  in between when she was in steven

  and when she was back in bergen to die

  yeah or it kind of feels like

  it could have been her but it lends more

  towards his witness statement

  because he hasn't corrected the dates

  does that make sense to you no

  but he could have not remembered i don't

  know

  but also he said that

  it's a hike that people don't

  do which also then begs the question of

  how

  a bloke and his two daughters founder in

  the first place

  yeah yeah like why the are they

  going rambling

  on this impossible hike in the middle of

  death valley it isn't actually

  impossible i

  understand no but like all of these

  sources have said that it's a really

  difficult hike

  yeah it's called ice valley it's in the

  middle of nowhere

  why would you pick this location as a

  family hike

  i understand what you mean but like as a

  scandinavian

  myself i know that norwegians hike

  all the time why does this place have

  such

  a bad reputation i think they've

  hyperbolized happened

  what did you say hyperbolized

  hyperbolized i can't just like i just

  enjoyed the throwback

  yeah hyperbolized

  the actual danger of this hike it's not

  like you're gonna be eaten

  by a panther you know no i

  i understand that it's a physically

  difficult hike yeah so

  because of the fact that she wasn't

  dressed for a hike

  or had hiking equipment with her

  people find it that's what made it

  suspicious okay yeah

  because like norwegians hike as

  not only a hobby it's a way of life like

  all norwegians have like summer houses

  in the mountains

  and then obviously you have to traverse

  a mountain just to get to a local shop

  i can't 100 understand it because i'm

  swedish

  but my grandparents in the north of

  sweden

  used to walk for weeks like they would

  go in the middle of nowhere

  for weeks for pleasure you know

  it's not actually sounds like sweden

  doesn't have the same rate of happiness

  as finland does

  as denmark does denmark is the happiest

  place

  no finland's the happiest place

  denmark's the highest

  drinking place i think denmark is the

  highest

  dream no yeah no

  finland is the happiest place

  finland has the most finland is the

  happiest

  place they're very good at school

  trademark in europe they're very

  copyright

  what i'm trying to say is that it's a

  difficult hike if you're not from there

  so he claims as i said that he

  met the istal woman on his way back to

  bergen

  he said that it robbed him the wrong way

  because she seemed

  distressed and or resigned

  he said that she seemed really sad

  obviously wasn't finnish

  also said that she was noticeably

  no norwegian because

  one she was dressed as

  a very fancy lady which is not what she

  would

  dress like on a hike never

  and especially with the weather in

  norway

  it always rains and it's very cold

  very very cold he also says

  that she first tried to say something to

  him

  but then changed her mind after glancing

  behind her

  and 20 meters behind her there were two

  men

  also noticeably not norwegian which

  means

  tanned and

  not dressed for a stroll in the woods

  which was like this was

  way out of bergen like they were not

  close to the city

  they couldn't have driven there yeah

  that's kind of what i have i have a

  couple of notes about

  popular series but i guess that

  maybe do you have something about the

  autopsy

  no

  nope fair enough okay

  you covered it at the beginning they

  found her pills and she were

  breathed in carbon monoxide yeah

  popular theories include that

  the isthal woman was hunting for nazi

  war criminals

  it's a good one and it's also because

  they think she might have been mossad

  yeah israeli secret service

  because of the fact that norway had a

  very

  good relationship with israel at the

  time

  during the years around her death

  like before and after the

  mossad were searching for nazi war

  criminals they also think that maybe she

  was a jewish child

  that was born in germany before the

  world war ii

  and then moved to another place maybe

  the german french border maybe france

  maybe

  after that the uk they're not sure

  which i think that it does speak

  to what kind of people secret service

  we're employing like the best spies

  do not have familiar relationships

  people that you can easily erase from

  history like from birth certificates

  from stuff like that people who are who

  don't

  have family more or less

  like it was a common theme that

  they would recruit spies that didn't

  have

  family and they also found

  well there was a big scandal like

  three years after she died

  about norway media

  finding kgb agents in norway

  who were norwegian kgb agents

  and also that people had been

  killed by the mossad in

  norway so maybe i don't know

  but it's a very nice like it's a very

  good

  storyline that she might have been

  hunting

  nazi war criminals i don't know it feels

  like a

  book you know any other good theories

  yeah i've got a theory yeah tell me

  all right so i think

  she was of jewish heritage supported by

  facts

  possibly so well they don't know if she

  was jewish

  no they don't know growing up in nazi

  germany

  i think when it all started to get

  serious she was moved

  to a different family out by the

  french german border they

  abused her either emotionally or

  physically we don't know

  hyperbole she then

  repressed this period of her life

  which explains why on all of her

  passports

  and the hotel registrations

  she was giving her date of birth as 10

  to 15 years

  after they dated her

  why would she have that many passports

  then

  wait for it so because

  she was abused in the nature that she

  was abused

  she developed some kind of psychiatric

  illness like a psychosis

  or split personality or whatever

  and this made her think that she was

  being pursued by people

  so she traversed all of

  scandinavia and europe and blah blah

  blah to try and escape

  these fictional people that were chasing

  her and recorded herself

  under false names and switched hotel

  rooms

  and all of this that and the other to

  try and escape from them

  and it got to the point where she was so

  psychologically stressed that she

  decided the only way to avoid this

  was to kill herself but she needed

  to make sure that she wasn't found

  because then the people that were

  following her would be able to do

  x y and z to her body so she identified

  a nice

  remote location decided

  to take the pills to numb the pain

  of burning her face

  so that she couldn't be identified

  which also would explain all of the

  labels being cut off of her clothes

  and all of her prescription medication

  and things like that being erased and

  all of her personal belongings being

  left in a train station

  while she disappeared off into the

  mountains to

  remove herself from history you think

  that the mental health

  story is the most plausible one

  interesting i don't think she was a spy

  for the simple fact that i don't think

  any nation would have

  such an easy way to discredit an

  identity

  i don't think any kind of international

  spy organization would create an

  identity that was

  just a name some people on the internet

  said that the names

  some of her aliases was very

  interchangeable

  so some of her names are some of her

  other names

  if you just add some lines to it

  which would explain that she was doing

  it herself rather than

  them being assigned identities to her

  yeah yeah i get i get what you mean it

  might have been

  mental health issues but i just think

  that burning yourself is such a bad idea

  she could have just waited for the pills

  to take no but she needed to remove

  her complete identity so when they found

  her they found that only the front

  of her body was burned and the back was

  completely untouched

  and that would make sense in that she

  was only trying to eradicate her face

  and her fingerprints and anything like

  that

  whereas if she were being burned to

  remove

  all evidence then whoever was doing it

  to her

  would have done it to a degree where her

  entire body was burned

  yeah i get what we mean you think that

  the secret service of

  whatever country she might have been

  affiliated with

  would have done a better job yeah i

  think

  if you're gonna burn somebody to get rid

  of a body

  you do it so that they are burnt down to

  the bones

  one of the most famous norwegian

  spy hunters in their history

  or like recorded history through a cold

  war and stuff like that

  says that it was an accident

  he was like maybe she tried to kill

  herself with the pills

  and then her hair spray can rolled into

  the fire and exploded in their face and

  then

  she might have like fallen wasn't that

  discredited

  by there being no evidence of an

  explosion

  well it was it wasn't that it was

  discredited by the fact that there was

  no evidence

  of a hairspray can like he was like

  that and if you throw a can of hairspray

  or

  anything with an aerosol in it into a

  fire it explodes

  so you'd get burned debris scattered

  everywhere and it wasn't it was entirely

  localized to

  the front of her body yeah

  and he said that maybe she fell off the

  ledge and then hit her neck

  on the way down because he thinks or he

  says that he thinks that it's

  an accident that she tried to kill

  herself

  and then burnt herself by accident

  well i'm not it's possible that she

  burnt herself by accident

  if she had a campfire

  no but then it's not i was going to say

  if she had like a campfire took the

  pills got drowsy fell over but she was

  found face up

  so it discredits that theory as well no

  that's what he

  thinks that she had a campfire

  her hairspray can rolled into the fire

  exploded in her face and then she fell

  off the ledge

  of the mountain there's not enough

  flammable material in just an exploded

  hairspray canister to cause the full

  frontal burning that was caused on her

  she would have had to like have doused

  herself

  in hair spray or petrol or whatever for

  that explosion to

  decimate the front of her body in the

  way that it was

  yeah that's what i think too because her

  front of her legs

  her kneecaps everything was like burnt

  on the front of her body was like super

  burnt

  i don't believe that theory

  because where would she get the money

  from

  she was recorded to have traveled all

  over europe

  staying in different hotels

  paid in cash she was oh we don't know

  anything about her

  so she could have had a rich family yeah

  but she was recorded

  having meetings with men

  that nobody knows who they are not the

  eyewitness statement on the trail

  singularly but others as well

  like in the hotels that she stayed at in

  the rooms that she

  say that the maids and the waitresses

  saw her having air quotes

  meetings with other men

  so like if she was just running all over

  europe why would she meet other men

  you know to ask for protection um

  i'm not sure no i'm sure that's why it's

  a mystery

  i still think it's the psychosis this is

  actually

  super interesting do you actually think

  that it was a psychosis

  yeah to me that's what makes the most

  sense

  what i i can't get over the idea that

  any kind of spy agency would give her

  such

  terrible identities if a kgb off a

  former kgb

  officer who was active during the cold

  war

  is giving a statement to say that

  there's no way she was a spy because the

  nature of her identities are inscrutable

  there's no way she was a spy he said

  that she could have been a courier

  like she could have been a person who

  had information and then traveled

  to give information to another person

  he said that that was he was like that's

  entirely plausible

  she could because she probably wasn't a

  spy

  because if she was a spy they would have

  planted her

  in the area that the penguin missiles

  were active in the testing was active in

  for however long it took he was like

  because she would have had to made

  friends

  and but if she was a courier just

  giving information from one person and

  another

  that would make sense because it doesn't

  require you to have a traceable

  identity i still think she was mental

  we're all mental what else is new

  i don't feel like it's beyond the

  possibility that she killed herself

  but if she killed herself i think it was

  because of depression and not because of

  a psychotic break

  if she killed herself i think it was

  because she maybe felt

  lonely if she didn't have any family

  which would point to the fact that she

  was never

  she has never been identified like

  nobody has ever come

  forward with information about her

  identity i feel like maybe

  that could have driven her to suicide

  but i don't think it was a psychotic

  break

  and if it wasn't a psychotic break her

  notes

  and her steps

  to become anonymous points to the fact

  that she was

  actually acting for someone else

  and not for herself

  like if she had a psychotic break she

  would just

  run out into the woods years

  earlier she did not have a psychotic

  break for

  years that's not how it works

  and giving a spy an identity that's just

  their name isn't how it works

  yeah i get what you mean we have reached

  an impasse

  i need to pee good lord you want to say

  bye

  to the listeners goodbye thank you for

<!--StartFragment-->

The case discussed this week is the unsolved mystery of the Isdal ("Ice Valley") Woman, who's identity remains unknown. Ruled a likely suicide, the case has been subject to speculation and investigation for half a century. Joe has a theory of his own, and Sandra goes down the conspiracy rabbit hole.
