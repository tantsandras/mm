  [Music]
  uh speaking of see a very strange german
  accents the chufa
  somehow decided to take on daniel farkas
  the manager of
  norwich football club unfortunately have
  been relegated from the premier league
  and so we will no longer be experiencing
  it's very fast and very camping by
  german
  media conferences which i'm a little bit
  sad about i was quite hoping that
  norwich would find a way to stay in the
  premier league as long as it wasn't at
  the expense of watford football club
  yeah i'm going to miss him we will have
  to
  bestow our uh oh
  thank you very much daniel farker for
  providing us with
  a stereotypical german man uh
  everyone
  [Laughter]
  i said thank you
  i wanted to thank him okay
  i've only seen this interview once
  because you sent me the link to it
  but i do i do feel like it enriched in
  my life
  oh have i told you about the time when
  a german guy on the course well he
  wasn't
  on my course but he was a mentor
  for us so he was working at the space
  when we were having our
  course he was like from the course
  before me
  and i felt like he was never as much
  german as he was when we were both
  in the toilets together not in the same
  way
  weird not in the same toilet
  the toilets next to each other and then
  exiting the toilets we
  opened our doors into each other
  like into each other's doors and he had
  this
  weird meltdown and i just felt like this
  is the
  most german i've ever seen him because
  he was like
  how have they built these toilets
  it's inexplicable i would never get away
  with this in germany
  yes and i understood him
  completely because it's true
  it was built so badly and i just felt
  like
  oh my god this is so true and it's
  true for sweden as well they would have
  never
  like released that into the public they
  would have been like
  no no the doors open into each other we
  can't have that
  no they don't care in england have you
  ever been to the toilet in america
  no well i feel like unless you've had
  that experience
  you can't comment about poor british
  toilet design
  the doors in american toilets
  uh the cubicles specifically have like
  a massive like almost a meter gap at the
  bottom of the door
  oh no it's like it's like a genuinely
  like
  50 to 70 centimeter gap that a
  child can crawl under no
  oh no and then and then the side of the
  doors
  have got like a two or three centimeter
  gap
  so you can if you wanted to you could
  very easily see
  someone having a shit how is that like
  why cheaper in it why pay for a bigger
  door when you can have a bit of
  voyeurism
  [Music]
  ain't that the truth about america
  i had another funny story yeah i think
  that it was
  when i first moved here i felt like i
  had never known
  adversary like i have
  when i first moved here and realized
  that the british plumbing system
  is as old as the british empire
  itself if not older
  i feel like we should also stipulate at
  this point
  that i have not known anyone to use as
  much
  toilet paper as you do
  so where our plumbing system
  is sufficient to
  flush a small dog
  you somehow go above and beyond that
  by using like half a roll of toilet
  paper just for a pee
  it is so true
  i have never once blocked
  a uk toilet
  [Laughter]
  we need to know if you're gonna stay
  overnight in advance to work out if we
  need to go and buy more toilet roll
  i'm finally off
  [Laughter]
  sandra's coming round oh is she staying
  yeah is that going to be a problem no
  we've got enough food but we might not
  have enough toilet roll
  how much have we got six rolls how long
  she's staying
  at night i should probably get some more
  i
  eat as a small child
  and yet i poof like an
  elephant
  [Music]
  [Laughter]
  they're gravity fed you pull
  the handle or the chain and it releases
  the stock plug
  and the water falls through into the
  toilet bowl
  the fact that you have still have chains
  is
  inexplicable because when i got a
  a duplo like house
  when i was eight living in london
  i got a toilet for the house
  with the little chain on it when i went
  back to sweden
  people did not understand what that was
  that's how different it is for when the
  toilet water storage is above
  the toilet bowl yeah but we don't you
  don't get a chain
  on modern toilets and it's not our fault
  that thomas crapper was the man who
  invented the toilet and invented it that
  way and just so happened to be british
  wait was his name thomas crapper
  yeah that's the best thing
  i've ever heard in my life it can
  actually in some places
  still find crapper branded taps
  oh that's hilarious oh my god
  i mean if that's your name you have to
  go into plumbing oh
  that's true it's true just saying
  a poor workman blames his tools
  [Laughter]
  you should poop in sweden man it's so
  good
  you come and live in this country and
  say that our plumbing system
  shit at least you can wipe your crayola
  butt
  and still manage to put the toilet in
  the same place your shit goes
  okay are you ready to start the case
  about 40 minutes ago
  well actually i wasn't there's no
  evidence in this case
  are you ready uh
  okay i've only got two left
  i have to go through this case pretty
  quickly okay
  you're listening to midweek murders
  which means that it's time
  to talk about crime this is my friend
  joe
  hello and this is my friend sandra
  hey yeah
  this week we're gonna talk about levi
  bellfield levi
  oh no not already
  the first word levi bellfield
  who is a serial killer oh my god
  and also seems to be a very insecure
  person with a very small dick allegedly
  a very small dick but also
  very good at getting away with crime
  yeah which was
  surprising we can start at the
  disappearance of midly dowler
  no let's start with our references oh
  yeah
  let's start with with which
  with wit with our references
  i got my information from
  wikipedia and from a
  documentary series called evil up close
  but they do other cases as well i think
  that this was just one of the episodes
  i got mine also from wikipedia
  that's my go-to a website called crime
  and investigation uk
  chillingcrimes.com and
  a character witness on i think the bbc
  uh from his ex-girlfriend oh yeah what's
  that
  joe not you joe no i'm joe
  no his second wife i think no
  uh was i want to say
  emma but i didn't write down her name
  we can start at the disappearance of
  milly dowler at 3
  07 p.m on the 21st
  first of march 2002
  dowler left her school and walked
  to a radio station with her friend
  i think they went to eat at another
  railway station
  on the way to her house so yeah she
  stopped one
  station short of where she would usually
  get off the train
  and they went and had fish and chips
  and they got a portion of chips for 90
  pence
  which just brings me back to the day of
  when you could afford to buy things for
  less than a pound
  what i know right
  that was the most shocking part of this
  whole research investigation
  was a portion of chips in 2002 cost 90
  pence
  in london that is amazing
  she phoned her father quarter to
  four to say that she would be home in
  like 30 minutes
  give or take the girls left the
  cafe five minutes past four
  and then dowler or midly
  was last seen three minutes later
  by a friend of her sister who was
  waiting at the bus stop
  they had a conversation and then i think
  she was spotted by cctv
  a short distance from that bus stop
  where she was talking to her friend
  and then no more cctv
  footage was found of her
  and at first they hoped
  that she was a runaway but then
  like i think it was six
  months later or something like that yeah
  in september
  they found the body of millie dowler
  which was unfortunately decomposed
  so much that there was only bones
  left so they positively id'd her
  by her dental records they couldn't find
  out
  how she was murdered and stuff like that
  because there was
  no soft tissue left
  after that marsha mcdonald was
  beaten over the head with a blunt
  instrument near her home like
  very close to her own porch or front
  step
  in february 2003
  the wound was afflicted to her very
  shortly after she got
  off the bus another victim
  was kate sheedy she was 18 years old and
  she was run over
  twice near an entrance to the industrial
  estate
  in eisworth on 28th
  of may 2004 she
  managed to call
  the yeah she called emergency services
  and was on a call with them saying that
  she had
  been run over twice after that
  in the evening of the 19th of august
  2004
  amelie de la ranch was
  attacked and then died in the hospital
  after missing her bus stop
  with one stop talking to the bus driver
  and the bus driver said
  the other bus going back to where you
  came from
  is like in 10 minutes so she walked
  across the street
  and waited there for the bus to come and
  she was attacked and later died
  because of those injuries and
  levy levi
  bellfield was charged
  of these murders but also
  an abduction and an attempted murder of
  anna marie rennie
  in 2001 she managed to escape him
  fortunately but he tried to
  abduct her on the 14th october 2001
  and he was also charged with the
  attempted murder of
  irma dragoshi in longford
  on the 16th december of 2000 and
  2000 2003
  before that he had drugged and raped
  what are you doing are you scratching
  something sorry i was playing with my
  cable
  i didn't think you could hear that
  i can hear everything just like google
  they are listening to us hello google
  nice to meet you sorry for my browser
  [Music]
  history
  but also there was a lot of underaged
  girls who had reported being drugged and
  raped
  to the police which he
  was in charge for i think because he was
  already
  sentenced for the murders before
  they brought those charges up but this
  happened before
  the murderers that they know of and
  before
  that he was a domestic abuser
  and he also attempted to kill
  one of his friends by hitting him in the
  back of his head with a hammer
  that friend woke up in the hospital like
  six weeks later or something like that
  and levi managed to talk himself
  into visiting him and tried to shut off
  his life support machines
  and one of the murders happened or
  attacks
  happened just outside of that hospital
  which brings me to the question one
  how come they felt like there was
  insufficient evidence
  to at least look into these
  accusations about being drugged and then
  raped
  by all of these young teenagers
  and two that friend that he attacked
  with a hammer
  he said that the last thing he remembers
  is an argument between him
  and levi so he's basically told the
  police that he must have been the one
  to attack me in the documentary they all
  said like there was
  insufficient evidence but it kind of
  looks like
  they didn't even look into it so with
  the sexual abuse claims it's
  incredibly difficult to get a positive
  prosecution
  without the victim presenting
  to the police or paramedics doctors
  whatever almost immediately after it's
  happened
  and with particularly younger
  victims there's inherently a case of
  shame
  and self-blame behind sexual assaults
  in that they will feel like they've done
  something wrong
  they can't go to the police because the
  police will ask
  well why were you hanging around with
  this 30-plus year old man
  but they didn't the thing is he was a
  bouncer
  at a club i understand what you're
  saying like
  if they went to the police after waking
  up
  maybe if you had
  there's no physical evidence remaining
  so unless you report it
  before and a lot of the psychology
  behind sexual assaults
  is that you feel dirty and used and you
  just want to cleanse yourself
  so one of the first instincts for people
  that have experienced
  sexual assault is to either have a
  shower or a bath
  and that's the worst thing you can do
  for physical evidence
  in terms of a rape allegation so
  if you take away the physical evidence
  all you've got is that he said she said
  case
  which is not enough in a court of law
  to prove a case of sexual assault yeah i
  understand that but the problem here
  is that there were so many
  of these accusations being made and
  these
  reports to the police being made that
  they
  should have at least looked into it
  like i understand that they did look
  into it
  but there wasn't enough evidence to
  prosecute so they're not saying that it
  didn't happen
  but in the back of a police officer's
  mind
  is always can we get a positive
  prosecution out of this
  so they could have sat down with the
  survivor they could have sat down with
  levi
  and gone through the story and all he
  needs to say
  is that didn't happen that plants the
  seed of doubt in a jury's mind
  so if you've if you haven't got the
  fallback of physical evidence
  there's not enough evidence to prove
  this is what happened and it's a flaw in
  our judicial system because that's why
  so many rape survivors don't
  go to the police or will go to the
  police
  after they've cleansed themselves
  and yeah it puts the police and the
  crown prosecution in a really difficult
  place because they want to help the
  survivor
  but they're very limited in what they
  can actually do
  because there's no corroborating
  evidence to support that
  from what i understand it they didn't
  formally
  accuse him like the police or the
  prosecution
  didn't formally accuse him until after
  he was already being accused of the
  murders
  but this happened before the murders
  or well it's the same with any
  historical case of sexual abuse you only
  have to look at
  the celebrities that have been in the
  light of media
  relatively recently and you look at
  epstein
  and rolf harris and as soon as you get
  that person in court
  it becomes much easier for previous
  victims to come forward
  and for police to add on
  this he said she said evidence
  as more of circumstantial evidence to
  the prosecutions they're putting forward
  at the time
  because there was no physical evidence
  yeah
  as soon as soon as harvey weinstein went
  to court with firm evidential
  allegations of sexual abuse and
  advantageousism and all of the other
  things he was charged for
  all of these other women that had been
  victimized by him
  also came forward and they used
  their witness statements as
  corroborating evidence
  but they couldn't use those statements
  in themselves as a prosecution because
  there wasn't
  enough evidence to corroborate the story
  i
  i understand that but i do feel like the
  police
  should have kind of put it in their
  system
  as like these allegations have been made
  these police reports have been made at
  that time
  i don't think they even looked into him
  or the club where he worked at or
  anything like that and they should have
  flagged him or something like
  even just put him in the system ass like
  this
  is these uh accusations against him
  yeah because i feel like i know this is
  easy for me to say as like an outsider
  i'm not a lawyer i'm not a policeman i'm
  not
  any of that but i do feel like if
  there's
  so many accusations being made
  you need to look into that person if you
  look into that person
  you might find physical evidence
  somewhere else like if the victims
  come forward and he could have skin
  cells
  under his nails if he scratched them
  during a struggle yeah yeah and that's
  that's very much a fault of the police
  department at the time
  and there's no arguing against that they
  they obviously didn't take these
  allegations
  seriously and it very well could have
  been
  that and this is an interesting point
  actually is that
  the officer that was in charge of
  looking at
  millie's case did say that if they had
  not focused in other areas
  they could have stopped marsha mcdonald
  and emily from being murdered
  they weren't focusing where they should
  have focused
  and that caused them to miss key
  factors in levi's personality
  that could have led them to his arrest
  sooner
  yeah this is what i don't understand i
  think
  when i first read about the case i was
  first
  curious about the cctv footage
  because even in 2002
  there was cameras around in england
  which is like
  england is one of the most video
  recorded
  countries in the world like there's so
  much
  footage everywhere which makes it
  even harder for me to understand i think
  because i feel like well
  when i watched the i should explain to
  the listeners that when i watched the
  documentary they did point out the fact
  that he was calculating about
  these things like he would use vehicles
  that was not
  his he would buy and sell
  vehicles all the time so that he
  wouldn't be
  registered to the vehicles
  that he used in his crimes stuff like
  that he
  apparently turned his phone off during
  the murder of
  uh millie so that his phone records
  couldn't be tracked across like the
  areas where he was and where he buried
  her so he was calculating
  and stuff like that i understand that
  and he didn't leave much evidence
  in his attacks and in his
  rapes stuff like that but i just felt
  like there was so
  many warning flags that were brought
  to the police that they could have acted
  on
  like the friend that he attacked with a
  hammer
  he told the police that it was
  levi he couldn't be sure because he
  couldn't remember
  the actual like attack but it was
  straight after being in an altercation
  with levi
  it was walking down the stairs from the
  flat that they
  rented together that he was attacked
  so who else could it have been you have
  to take into consideration with
  this kind of thing that all of the
  evidence
  that is being presented is
  circumstantial
  and without hard evidence
  to prove anything
  most cases will not go full
  to prosecution and although you can look
  at and say yes okay the last person he
  spoke to was levi
  the last thing he remembers was having
  an argument with levi it was outside
  levi's
  house if levi then gets questioned by
  the police and says
  no actually the altercation wasn't that
  serious
  he left my flat and that's the last
  thing
  i knew and that gets corroborated with
  whoever he's living with yeah they were
  both here the guy
  left levi stayed it was their apartment
  okay there's nowhere for the police to
  take
  that but when you're actually the
  officer responding to that case
  you can't present to your senior and
  then the crown prosecution service
  with this all lends towards levi
  having assaulted this person you need
  more firm evidence than that and i think
  that's where
  a lot of these cases fell down against
  him was he was so good at covering his
  tracks
  he made it almost impossible for the
  police to
  link him with any of these crimes
  but i also feel like they didn't do
  enough investigation because if they had
  investigated
  all of these police reports even though
  there was not enough
  physical evidence and then gotten this
  police report from the guy in hospital
  being attacked
  he should have been in their system
  which he probably was already
  but not for those kind of offenses
  what happened then was that
  his second wife joe not
  you obviously another joe i
  never married him i'm almost positively
  sure
  he's not my type
  she called the police because they had
  taken a photo of a car
  from probably cctv posted it in the
  media
  and said if you have any information
  about this vehicle
  please contact us and she saw
  the vehicle and as she tells it
  in the documentary series she was like
  hmm this i'm almost
  positive that this is one
  of several of the vehicles that
  levi is operating
  so she called another friend to make
  sure that she wasn't
  mistaken and she was like oh he does
  drive one of these person wagons and i
  was like what kind of
  english is that the first car
  was the one that he uh
  used to attack millie oh i wrote it down
  somewhere
  where is it yeah that was a red car that
  was like a
  a daewoo nexia um but yeah he also
  operated as a wheel clamper so he had a
  white
  van so i think when they say person
  wagon they just mean
  a small van yeah he had several
  different
  vehicles and he was regularly
  buying and selling cars and he was also
  like he borrowed one of his other
  friends cars and then he said
  that was stolen but it wasn't
  he just sold it on because he probably
  committed a crime
  with that car he obviously was
  smart about it people who knew him
  said that he was very manipulative
  like in the in the way that he could
  present the persona that was extremely
  likable
  and caring and a lot of people fell for
  it so he had a lot of friends
  he had a lot of girlfriends he had like
  11 children which is crazy
  so i understand that he was very
  two-faced
  which is very common for people who are
  psychopaths that's probably not the
  correct psychological
  term his second wife
  called the police and said that
  this vehicle that you need information
  about i think that she had left him
  at the time so she said i think that
  this
  might be the person you're looking for
  which was levi
  and they asked her what would be the
  motivation
  and she was like i don't know maybe
  because he
  hated blonde women or girls
  i feel like searching for a
  motivation in people like
  levi or other serial killers
  is a bit moot it doesn't actually
  matter because they're violent
  offenders and they don't
  generally make sense to people who
  aren't psychopaths
  in the documentary people would say like
  but what is the motivation
  maybe he was hurt as a child it doesn't
  actually
  matter i think levi
  was just a violent sociopath
  and taking steroids steroids
  steroids yeah obviously makes
  you more aggressive searching for like a
  motivation
  like he was just fucked up he was just
  super violent
  he would attack people at random does
  that make sense
  yeah but i also think that motive is one
  of the things
  that is drilled into crime investigation
  because but if you don't know to start
  with that
  your perpetrator is a sociopath or a
  psychopath then
  you need probable cause yeah and if
  there is no probable cause
  then fine you you drop that issue and
  you'd look at
  the mental state of the person
  committing the crimes but i think to say
  that
  there's no point looking at motive when
  you know they're a sociopath
  it's sort of chicken and egg it's easy
  to say
  from like the aftermath
  probably in in hindsight knowing
  his mental condition and
  the fact that he was a serial offender
  rules out the fact that he probably had
  any motive
  but when you are first given the crime a
  motive
  can really help you rule out suspects so
  like
  millie's dad was a suspect throughout
  quite a lot of the trial but he had no
  motive
  so there was no real need to push
  and press with the prosecution of the
  dad
  because a lack of motive means that he's
  unlikely to be the suspect yeah for a
  normal person
  but at what stage do you stop looking at
  motive and start looking at psychology
  i think is easy to tell with hindsight
  but
  you have to keep motive in perspective
  when you're investigating a crime
  until it's safe enough to rule out
  joe his second wife
  she said that he had a deep hatred
  towards
  women in general and towards blondes
  especially there was a modus operandi
  on the wiki page the murder victims that
  he was
  charged for was blonde and i feel like
  yeah he had
  a weird obsession with hating women
  that is it's very common for a lot of
  male
  offenders i just feel like they're kind
  of grasping at straws
  being like oh but why some people don't
  have a why
  that's just what i'm thinking but you
  have to get to the stage to be able to
  rule out the why
  and until you get to that stage you have
  to always consider the why
  yeah if you if you go into your whole
  investigation without looking
  at anybody who would have probable cause
  to commit these crimes you could be
  ruling out a whole
  arm load of suspects yeah no i
  understand that i just felt like
  the fact that they wanted to like
  psychoanalyze him i guess
  by being like what kind of childhood
  drama
  did this that's that's
  also a very important part of the
  defense
  because if the defense wants to plead
  insanity
  then they would have to psychoanalyze
  him
  and if he was say previously
  abused by a blonde woman
  then it would be rational
  for him to have this hatred and they
  could use that in his defense
  well it wouldn't be irrational but that
  would be a case against the insanity
  plead
  the thing that bothers me about it i
  think
  is that when they seared him on him as a
  suspect he is not insane
  he is 100 calculative and
  pre-meditative in his crimes and looking
  for a
  okay i was gonna go into the whole bundy
  discussion but we cannot just not do
  that
  do you have any like what did you
  research
  during your forensic science research
  it's a very good question because
  there is no physical evidence
  in this case at all and it's quite
  interesting
  that actually the prosecution for
  millie's murder was entirely
  circumstantial
  in that he was already on trial
  for the murders of the other two
  women i think he was already sentenced
  yes yeah so he got a life sentence
  for the deaths of those two women
  but the evidence that they put forward
  for
  prosecuting him for millie's death was
  entirely circumstantial
  and i actually found a quote from the
  judge
  that said addressing to the jury during
  his trial
  a lack of proof of the mechanism of
  abduction
  and the cause of death in milly's case
  is therefore
  no impediment to prosecution and
  conviction
  i was always trained that circumstantial
  evidence would never even go to court
  so from a forensics point of view i have
  no idea how they managed to get away
  with charging him on this
  i think it was probably because they
  recorded
  the vehicle on the cctv
  but it's circumstantial yes the vehicle
  that his girlfriend owned that he
  admitted to driving
  and she admitted to lending him and that
  he was regularly driving
  was spotted in the area at the time that
  millie disappeared
  yeah but that's circumstantial yeah
  and i mean he later admitted to all of
  the crimes
  yeah so i guess it's all of a moot point
  really but in terms of actual
  legal prosecution they the
  evidence that they gathered was enough
  of the picture
  to be able to say that he was the
  perpetrator
  but i think a decent defense lawyer
  would have been able to get him off
  yeah but also i think it was also that
  his girlfriend or wife at the time
  saw him discard of evidence even though
  she didn't know
  it was evidence she did i don't think
  she saw him discard it
  but he came back after millie's
  disappearance in different
  clothes than the ones he left in he also
  got rid of their bed sheets or something
  like that
  yeah so he he was covering his tracks
  and acting suspiciously
  but again without that physical evidence
  it's
  all just pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
  that the prosecution are putting
  together to create
  enough of a picture to be able to
  determine the whole story yeah
  definitely did you find any kind of
  physical evidence for the other murder
  victims
  the post-mortem said that they were both
  bludgeoned
  with a blunt instrument they both
  suffered
  incredibly similar trauma which is what
  the police used to link the two
  murders marsha and emily together
  but i don't think they ever found the
  murder weapon
  not that i could find in researching
  okay
  i think it was a hammer but not a hammer
  i think there was another
  word for it like a sledge a sledgehammer
  yeah that's a thing
  something like that i think the guy
  who ended up in the hospital was
  attacked with the same
  instrument the officer that
  ended up looking into the whole series
  of events
  uh was the only one that linked
  marsha and emily's murders together
  again they had no motive but because of
  the similarity and the traumas that they
  both
  suffered they were able to assume
  that it was the same person with the
  same
  type of weapon at least but that i don't
  think they ever matched
  the weapon in levi's possession
  to the one that caused the damage okay
  but again it's very that i found almost
  no details on
  marsha and emily's records and
  postmortems and the evidence that was
  used to charge him for those crimes
  but he got charged for them and he got
  given an entire life sentence
  i think he was given two life sentences
  he was given
  one life sentence for marsha and emily
  for their murders
  and the attempted murder of kate sheedy
  and the judge said there that this life
  sentence will be your life
  it's not 25 years which is a typical
  life sentence yeah he recommended him to
  never be let out
  that was in millie's case so when the
  second case of millie's murder
  got put forward he was given an
  additional
  life sentence on top of his life
  sentence
  and then the judge said you will spend
  the rest of your life in jail
  and he's the only person in the uk
  who has ever been sentenced to two
  full-term life sentences i didn't know
  that
  that's interesting because we like to
  give people
  life sentences and then only charge them
  25 years and then they get out on 10 for
  good behavior
  yeah that's a bit weird we have the same
  in sweden but we probably have
  more lex ones there's been a lot of
  weird
  sentencing behavior going on but also we
  don't have
  that much cases of reoffending
  in the same way that the like america
  has like
  super strong sentences for some cases
  and then
  there's a higher risk of reoffending
  because they don't actually get
  any help stuff like that in sweden they
  get
  a lot of help which i think is good
  but for some offenses
  i kind of feel like they should be super
  incarcerated but levi if you're
  listening
  fuck off your scumbag count
  to that but i kind of feel like it's
  good that i think they
  also realize that if you can't have you
  can't see any motive
  they're that much more dangerous to
  society
  i'm sorry for making you change the zoom
  it's better for the audio but good lord
  it was a
  fucking pain man fucking pain
  yes yes it was
  oh and thank you frank and surely
  what's his name not frankie fucker
  fucker oh thank you
  you're being racist now
  [Laughter]
  oh my god you also sound more like an
  austrian than a german
  because you can tell the difference
  you're actually german your surname's
  growl yeah
  yeah well i am long away though
  it was a couple of hundred years ago
  mm-hmm
  that's what i want to stay
  that's what trump says blue eyes
  german surname suspicious
  trump and his dad used to tell people
  that they were swedish for a lot of
  years
  turns out they are german yeah
  i'll never switch yeah the uh windsors
  like to tell people that they're english
  but they're
  german yeah and the
  swedish queen german yeah
  and uh swedish king lunatic
  [Laughter]
  well it is not that unrelated
  to heritage just crazy
  [Laughter]
  but kind of true but also just like he's
  i don't feel bad for him because he's
  not
  someone that you would feel bad for but
  he's
  a dick i'm not gonna be welcome home to
  sweden anytime soon
  and also the that's treason you're gonna
  be put to death
  the prince of sweden he married
  a girl that looks exactly like his
  mother
  which is a bit weird prince of serbia
  sex pest well they're all allegedly sex
  perverts because they can do
  whatever they want and nobody cares
  because they're royalty
  yeah try telling that to prince andrew
  saw a documentary about ein epstein
  einstein i saw a documentary about
  einstein did you know he came up with
  the theory of general relativity
  uh he also domestically abused his wife
  yeah he's a scumbag yeah but he's about
  two meters away from being extradited
  to the us to give
  testimony against epstein because they
  were
  super bloody close yeah and
  on the documentary there's a lot of
  eyewitnesses
  that have actually seen that sexual
  abuse
  which is good because
  he thinks that he can get away with
  anything because he's
  royal that's how they do it
  same as trump though he was all buddy
  buddy with them unless he watched fox
  news and then they cropping out
  that was funny speaking of cropping
  someone out
