Agneta Westlund was found dead by a lake in Sweden. The police arrested her husband, Ingemar, because they suspected that he had run her over with a lawn mower. But the evidence showed that something entirely different had happened. Joe talks about BlueStar, and Sandra gets confused about the plural of moose.
