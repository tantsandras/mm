it was interesting to me should we start

maybe

how could i regale you with this

exciting story

it's not going to be in the episode you

don't need to worry it's not me that i'm

worried for it's the poor listeners

you were riveted the whole time

\[Laughter]

i don't meet anyone i don't see anyone

let me have this okay i had to get it

all out okay

\[Music]

so

it's wednesday which means that it's

time to talk about crime

you're listening to midweek murders and

i'm sandra

and i'm joe merry christmas you filthy

animals

yeah i was uh pretty non-enthusiastic

well we are in \[ __ ] tier 4 which is a

made-up name

for lockdown isn't it pretty much yeah

yeah

i have no enthusiasm i'm sorry

oh it's not gonna be christmas for me

well i'm gonna make a bit of a christmas

i'm not

an idiot i know what you have to do to

keep your mental health in check

put up \[ __ ] loads of fairy lights so it

looks like

a cringe spilled all of his loot

everywhere and then you force your mind

to think

look at the pretty lights do you need

help

\[Laughter]

always

\[Laughter]

okay so this week we're going to talk

about the murder of isabella roxton

and mary jane rogerson i got my

information from

wikipedia the most comprehensive

wikipedia post

there ever was recommended

an article in gettysburg times

from 1935 and an article

from ottawa citizen from 1936.

i got mine from wikipedia and my brain

\[Laughter]

let's see what's in there then shall we

both non-reputable sources of

information

please always check your sources

\[Laughter]

yep so isabella roxton was in a

relationship with a doctor named buck

although they referred to each other as

husband and wife

and the couple lived in lancaster in

lancashire

with their three children the house they

lived in was also where buck had his

medical practice

and the couple had a maid and living

nanny

named mary jane rogerson \[ __ ] was

an unstable sort of bloke who regularly

\[Laughter]

true story bro who regularly exploded

into fits of rage or bouts of hysteria

and self-pity that's a quote from the

wikipedia page

reportedly because he had become

paranoid about his relationship with

isabella

but probably because he was just that

kind of

bloke he was a typical abuser who would

beat

isabella and isabella in turn would

leave him

and then buck would cry and beg for her

to return

offering promises of changed behavior

in 1934 a lancaster police officer had

been called to the rockstar's house

following another instance of domestic

abuse at which point

buck made a threat to his wife's life

at this point which is quite incredulous

he was not arrested or anything it seems

like nothing happened

it didn't say what happened but i'm

guessing nothing happened

on the 14th of september the following

year

isabella had been in blackpool to visit

two of her sisters

and to attend the yearly light festival

she returned to the couple's home in

lancaster at approximately

11 30 in the evening at the home

buck murdered her and the nanny maryjane

supposedly because she either had been

there

when the murder of isabella was

committed or because he had found buck

with

isabella's body they're not sure

one day before the murders had taken

place bucket informed

one of the two part-time cleaners that

worked for the couple

not to come to the house until the 16th

and after an explanation he had told her

that

isabella and mary jane had gone to

edinburgh

edinburgh edinburgh edinburgh

which does it improv

the winter edinburgh

which does imply that he had planned to

murder

both isabella and mary jane

that's my editorializing i don't know if

that's true but i felt like it was weird

that he had made an explanation about

them

going away the day before he committed

the murders

pretty suspicious yeah on the day

after the murders he visited one of his

patients

who he asked for assistance from both

her and her husband

to help him prepare for the decorators

that he claimed had been arranged for

months previously

and were arriving that morning and i'm

like

is that something you ask of one of your

patients i guess it depends on how

healthy they are

if they're a 96 year old man

then perhaps you don't invite them round

to do the heavy lifting but

if they're in the prime of their life

why not take advantage of that

but as a patient i would be like uh no

this transgresses our professional

relationship

well i can see who would never get asked

for help

well i would do it if it was one of my

close friends

but my doctor i would be like no but

this was in the 1930s so i guess

everybody knew everyone in a way he

claimed

that he could not do this himself as he

had hurt his hand opening a tin

can of fruit like a little \[ __ ]

i hurt my hands cutting up my debit card

and i'm debilitated so

and then joe cut his hand cutting up a

debit card

like a little \[ __ ]

well i'm glad you're amused

you bleed a lot from your head i don't

clot very well so

it just keeps on opening up and bleeding

everywhere oh god

put a little bit of vaseline on that i

want to stop it bleeding not

lubricate it to stick in somewhere

buck's patient mrs hampshire

recalled that the house was in a state

of disarray

all the carpeting had been removed from

the stairs

and straw were littered all over the

floors

i thought you were pausing for dramatic

effect

not straw on the floor

one of me in a barn does this

look like a livery to you

rolls and rolls of carpet were all over

the place

including in the garden where she also

noticed

several burned towels mrs howell did

that in your news reader voice

no strength to be funny

rolls and rolls of carpet were found in

the garden

more on this story at nine o'clock

oh god i'm acting okay

you try to be funny and you turn into

sir trevor mcdonald

story of my life mrs hampshire

and her husband were given rolls of

stained stair carpeting

what a gift thank you for being such

wonderful customers i mean

patience here's some bloody carpet

as well as buck's stained suit but we're

expected to clean

this no no no the best part of this

is he gave them some used carpet

and a used dirty bloody stained suit

and said to them you can keep them if

you clean them

thanks bunk you know i've always wanted

a bit of carpet

actually yeah i was just uh take it down

to the dry

cleaners get it cleaned up and then uh

pop it on the mental piece yeah just

what we wanted buck thanks mate

\[ \_\_ ] \[ \_\_ ] first they have to go to

his house

and then as a payment you know

buck we uh we live in a bungalow

is that suit even mrs hampshire's

husband's size

we will never know oh god

it it's so stupid

after a couple of days buck visited mary

jane's parents

claiming that mary jane had fallen

pregnant

and that isabella had traveled somewhere

with her to arrange

an abortion for those of you who don't

know

abortions were illegal in britain and

buck used this to urge the rogersons

not to talk to the police he himself

went to the police though with the story

about isabella having

left him the rogersons were worried

about their daughter

and went to the roxton's home and he

paid them off with some bloody carpet

i'll give you some carpet if you don't

tell anyone here's a \[ __ ] suit

to find out more about where their

daughter was

at which point buck claimed that

isabella and mary jane had stolen

30 pounds from a safe and would surely

return when they ran

out of money this obviously made the

rogerson suspicious

as it contradicted the story bucket told

them previously

and they decided to go to the police to

file a missing person's report

more than two weeks after the murders

had taken place

susan haynes johnson was walking across

an

old stone bridge when she noticed a

wrapped bundle with a decomposed

human arm sticking out of it on the

embankment

of the stream below the police were

called

and after confirming that the arm had

belonged to a human

they conducted an extensive search of

the surrounding area in the nearby river

during the search they found two heads

and four further wrapped bundles

containing

body parts and these bundles were

wrapped

in clothing as i understand it now

bed sheets a pillowcase children's

clothing and some newspapers

which all become quite important

later oh yeah this is probably the time

where i'm gonna

ask you about the evidence ah

very interesting

so they found about 70

different pieces of human remains

which they linked back to all

originating from

two individual people they could work

out that it was two individual people

because obviously they had

things like four thigh bones and

unless they're a quadruped which they

couldn't have been because they

identified them as human

you said that earlier so they worked out

that the two people were of

differing heights which would have been

done by things like the length of their

thigh bones but you can also determine

that from

arm bone length and so on

they also worked out that the bodies had

been dismembered by someone with

extensive anatomical knowledge and the

reason being

it's supposedly almost impossible to

dismember a human body at the joints

with a knife without knowing the anatomy

behind the body and i assume it's things

like ligaments

and tendons and things like that and

knowing

where to cut all of the body parts were

found

with certain body parts removed and all

of the parts that were removed were

things that would have been used as key

identifiers in being able to

match the body to a person so

eyes ears some parts of their skin

their teeth fingerprints so anything

that could have been used

to positively identify that body had

been removed

which again whoa hold on mate you're

shouting

oh sorry \[ __ ] it chief

i did read that a gentle

person what is it a dentist

a gentle person

oh god it's been a long week for you

isn't it

i said it just a dentist

did identify some of the work on the

teeth

yeah so after they had made

semi-positive identification of the

bodies they got in touch with a local

dentist who did confirm

that some of the work that was done on

the teeth that remained

was work that he had carried out so

the idea behind buck removing the teeth

would have been to try and reduce the

ease

of being able to match the evidence that

was left with dental records

but obviously he didn't manage to remove

all of the teeth of significance because

like you say it was matched by

a dentist saying yes i've carried out

this work this is mine

i've done this i think you mean a gentle

person

a dental person did manage to confirm

that they had done some

teeth work on these people

the fusion of the skulls

showed that one of the victims was

between the

age of 30 and 55 probably

more likely to be between 35 and 45

and one was much younger at

18 to 25 or more likely to be 20 or 21

and they can tell that because when you

age

you've got certain plates in your skull

that will fuse together after time

so when you're a baby you actually have

way

more bones in your body than you do as

an adult

so an adult has 206 bones

that's a fun fact for you but a child or

a baby will have a lot more than that

because

bones like their skull won't have fused

together yet

they're not fully fused i'm not a

philips hue

i think they also managed to because of

the newspapers

that the body parts were wrapped in they

managed to pinpoint

a location of where oh yeah see that was

a big boo-boo on buck's part that was

beautifully alliterative

if i do say so myself

i'm not technically a writer so like we

said earlier

all the body parts were wrapped in

either bed sheets

children's clothing or newspapers and we

said that

that would all become significant later

and that later

is now thanks for sticking with us

so the newspapers were a special edition

that were only published on the 15th

of september in morkum and lancaster

yeah so buck you \[ __ ] idiot

didn't use a generic newspaper to wrap

the body parts in he used an incredibly

specific one

that was incredibly easy to narrow down

the location of where these bodies were

wrapped not necessarily

where the murders took place or anything

more than that

at this stage it did narrow it down yeah

yeah they narrowed it down to two towns

more come or

lancaster the bed sheets were

examined by a forensic textiles

expert i didn't know that existed

in the 1930s that's really cool yeah i

mean

the examination process was just

microscopy so really it's just someone

that knows how to look at fibers under a

microscope

but they found that all of the samples

of bed sheet that were used to wrap the

bodies

had the exact same unique flaw

in the threading so that will be

that something in the manufacturing

process

has caused this floor so usually it will

be

some kind of machinery that's got a

specific dent in it

or a sewing machine that punches a

different space

every fifth punch something innocuous

like that but when you

look at it in terms of the bigger

picture it's really easy

to be able to spot that when you're

comparing

textile fibers they compared that to

the bed sheets in the ruxton's

master bedroom and surprise surprise

found exactly the same floor in the

bedsheets

as they did with the bed sheets that we

use to wrap the bodies

did you have anything more about the

autopsies

so while they were undertaking the

autopsy for the first

batch of body parts a further bundle

was found oh was it yes

this one contained the forearms

of the victims with the hands still

attached

he hadn't managed to completely remove

the fingerprints from the hands for this

second bundle

and they managed to get a full

fingerprint from one of the hands

which they later managed to match to

some items in the house that

mary jane would have normally handled so

given that she was the maid

it could have been cleaning utensils or

things in the kitchen

or something like that so they

positively matched the fingerprint

from the house to that of the hand

so they knew at least in this second

bundle

that parts of the body belonged to mary

jane

yeah while they were conducting the

autopsy

they found that the older body

had five stab wounds to the chest

multiple broken bones including the

hyoid bone

which is a little one in your neck so

she had been strangled and whether that

was

the actual cause of death or whether

that was just to subdue her

well he did whatever else he did they

don't know

the younger body had severe signs

of blunt force trauma on the limbs

and the head and again they're not sure

if that was the cause of death

and the reason they're not sure that

these were the ultimate cause of death

was

because of a combination of the decay of

the bodies

so they'd already started to came by the

time they found them

and the fact that the bodies were

completely mutilated

and they also brought in a forensic

entomologist which in the 1930s

was breaking ground yeah i was like

that's so

interesting because it feels like a new

study

i know it's not yeah forensic entomology

has obviously been around for

a long time now and when i was being

taught forensics

it was an incredibly useful tool to be

able to date

time of death for anybody who doesn't

know what forensic entomology is

it's looking at things like

flies and beetles

and maggots and their life cycles

in comparison to when a body

could have died yeah and nowadays they

can be

so exact can't they there's a big

problem with entomology being used

as a time of death marker oh and the

problem

is the environment yeah so the way that

forensic entomology works

is they will find and i'm going to use

blue bottle flies because they're the

most common in the uk to be used

and they are the first insect

on site of a dead body quite

interestingly

a blue bottle fly can detect

dead meat whether that be human or

animal

from 10 miles away oh god that's

so far that is a pretty impressive nose

for a little tiny fly

oh yeah so what will happen is the

forensic entomologist will examine the

body

and identify whether there are any

maggots whether there are any pupae

or larvae basically i didn't know it was

called

pupae and what did you think it was

called

i don't know the swedish word for it

is so they'll look for any pooper

\[Laughter]

so yeah they'll look for any insects and

whatever stage

of their development cycle they're in

they

will identify the exact species

that they found on the body and either

through reference material or through

their own

growing cycle they will determine at

what stage the body will have

died based on the stage

of the development of the insect now the

problem comes when you

introduce external factors so it's all

well and good doing this at room

temperature

if you dry the air so you reduce the

humidity

it dries out the body the cadaver and so

there's less food available for the

flies and the maggots

so it will take them longer to develop

their

growth cycle so to give you a comparison

a body that's been

hanged versus a body that's

been stabbed and has died prone on the

floor

you will get the maggot stage quicker

on the body that's been on the floor

than you will

to the body that's been hanged so

entomology would give

them a rough time frame and then they'd

use other techniques to

be able to determine it but given that

entomology was groundbreaking at the

time

they wouldn't have had any of the

further technology and one of the

biggest

problems with entomology is submerged

bodies

which is the case with this they were

found

in the river a lot of the species that

they look at to determine time of death

in entomology

don't lay their eggs underwater but i

also read that they could pinpoint

the approximate days when they

think that this crime happened no yes

i think they said that it was not

possible

for the bodies to have been discarded

before the 14th of september so they

gave

an approximation of when they could have

been put there which matches with the

paper because that was published on the

15th

but they couldn't say like they can

nowadays

that this person died 72 hours ago

yeah so on the 9th of october police

visited the rogersons

because they had filed the missing

persons reports and

showed them the pieces of clothing that

the body parts had been

wrapped in and asked them if they

recognized any of them

mrs rogerson instantly identified the

blouse

as having belonged to her daughter as it

had been mended

underneath one of the armpits and she

recognized

the patchwork they couldn't say whether

the children's

romper belonged to the ruxins but told

police that they needed to talk to

edith holm who isabella mary jane

and the roxton's children had been

staying with

at one point edits positively identified

the romper

as she had been the one to buy it for

one of the roxton's children

on the same day as the police had

managed to identify the pieces of

clothing

buck once again visited the lancaster

police

there he lamented about the supposed

rumors flying around

after the body parts had been discovered

about it being isabella and mary jane

he cried and complained about the rumors

being detrimental to his medical

practice

and his general reputation like a little

\[ __ ]

he told them to conduct discreet

inquiries

into his wife and nanny's whereabouts

and demanded that they search his

home to put an end to these rumors

like a little \[ __ ] the police placated

him

although they had already figured out

what had happened

as they had talked to his cleaner who as

we said

had seen the mess the house was in after

the murders

and been told all about the excuse

about mary jane and isabella being away

and stuff like that

and she had been specifically asked

to clean the yellow stained bathtub

they had also talked to buck's patient

mrs hampshire who as we talked about

had seen the roles of carpet and been

given rolls of carpet and the suit

so buck was arrested on the 12th of

october

at which point he pinned a note to the

entrance

to his medical practice stating remain

faithful to me in this hour i am an

innocent victim of

circumstances like a little \[ __ ]

when the police asked him to account for

his whereabouts

between the 14th and 29th of

september buck gave them a document he

had written

titled my movements not

suspicious at all i think it's

particularly helpful

it's incredibly stupid it's very art

attack

here's one i prepared earlier

the police had found extensive traces of

bloodstains

in the roxton's home even though it had

been cleaned

and redecorated they also found

human fat and body tissue in the drains

that led from the bathtub

when they managed to link the

fingerprints as we said

to mary jane because of the dusting of

the household items

buck was formally charged with her

murder on the

13th after being read the charge

buck said most empathically

not of course not the furthest thing

from my mind

what motive and why what are you talking

about

and i'm sure there was no oscar whispers

surrounding buck's performance

what a \[ __ ] what a little bit

i've abused myself almost a month later

after an x-ray of one of the skulls had

been positively matched to a photo

of isabella using forensic anthropology

buck was formally charged with the

murder of

isabella as well this is

a bit confusing to me i've seen bones

the tv show i've seen bones

i know what they look like i don't know

if you've seen that but it's a

forensic anthropologist probably that

works in

like a museum it went on for way too

many seasons i don't remember

all of it but she works for a museum to

date

like skeletons and stuff and then she

works

extra as a consultant i guess to the

police

that solves cases and \[ __ ] it was a

quite good

series i think i don't remember that

much about it

that good but

i know that they can now take a skull

and they know exactly

what the face would look like after

like doing stuff with computers

well i've seen it done before they add

the muscle tissue

and the stuff and then they have

nowadays

probably a very accurate depiction

of what the face looked like but in the

1930s

i know that they could do stuff with

clay and stuff

before they had computer programs to do

it all for them

they'd used to do it physically with

plasticine

so like you said they would add on the

muscle tissue and then add

the skin layers on top of that and it

would give them

a pretty accurate representation of

the face now it's obviously more

accurate because they're using

technology to do it for them but on the

basis of that

you can know that the structure of the

skull

will give an incredibly accurate

representation

of what their face looked like

if they can recreate a face just from

the skull with using plasticine

then you know that certain

characteristics

will be evident on the face dependent on

certain structures

in the skull so if you've got a cleft

palate

for example that will be reflected

in your skull in your mandible so i've

never had any experience either learning

or seeing this particular technique

being used

but i don't find it particularly

surprising

that they could superimpose the image of

the x-ray

onto a picture of her during life and be

able to

give a confirmational id

now it was challenged in court

and was one of the reasons

that buck appealed his conviction he

said

that because it was all done by one

person

that the evidence submitted was

subjective so

it's basically one person's opinion that

this is a positive match

i haven't seen the image and i've not

seen it been done before so i can't tell

you how accurate the representation

was or could be but given how

it is established anthropology to be

able to recreate faces from skulls

i don't find it too much of a stretch to

be able to imagine that it was

well done and also the supreme court

upheld

the original evidence yeah they at no

point ever threw

out as subjective evidence so

it must have been conclusive enough to

be able to match

well as we probably know by this time

it was isabella but i can't

imagine it being that far along

in the 1930s that they could recreate

an exact fizz or that they could see the

likeness

that much from an x-ray to a photo but

it must have been alike enough i'm

guessing i think

the clearest way that they would have

been able to tell

is to either reduce the x-ray or

enlarge the picture so that they're both

within the same ratios

yeah and then as you superimpose the

skull over the picture you're looking

for anything that doesn't match the two

pictures

so if her chin is protruding too much

for example yeah like mine

that will be very clear in my skull

that i have a very big chin or if

the eye sockets are too high or too

low in comparison to the forehead you

can actually

determine exactly where the nose and

ears are on a face from the skull

yeah i would be a handsome man i have a

good jawline

will you stop talking about yourself for

five

seconds

yeah no i get it no i get it it would be

a like enough they would look for

disgrace so there's actually a

mathematical formula for working out

where the ears are positioned based

on things like the eye socket ratios and

how big the forehead is and things like

that so they would look at all of that

and also things like if one side of the

face

when the skull was superimposed had like

too thick a layer of skin

if you know what i mean and things like

that so

i think there would have been enough to

be able to

make a positive enough id

that combined with all of the other

evidence

was conclusive enough again all of the

evidence in this case

like the last one is all circumstantial

apart from

mj yeah the fingerprints and uh yeah

yeah

i have a historical side note

when they found richard iii underneath

the parking lot

you know i know because you bring him up

every time

because they could genetically

identify him as richard iii because of

his

ancestors they could do

a render of what his face

looked like and that to me is so

cool there was portraits of him

but to see his actual face because

nowadays they're so

exact because of the computers

computers computers it was just so

cool i was like that's what he looked

like i can't believe it

i was flabbergasted

that's cause you're a history nerd yeah

do you want to know my reaction to when

they positively id'd richard iii

what oh cool was richard the third

\[Laughter]

they've also rendered a face of

ancient egypt's most written about

female like cleopatra no looks wise

everyone was like oh nefertiti was so so

beautiful she was incredibly beautiful

blah blah blah as beautiful as helen oh

helen of troy yeah she had a face that

launched a thousand ships

i got it because it was a history joke

\[Laughter]

no they did a re-render of her face

so during the trial the only witness for

the defense

was buck who when the judge told him to

answer the prosecutor's questions

dramatically sobbed i humbly beg your

pardon

but don't you see how he's driving me

into a corner

acting you're welcome

did you ever consider the stage as a

career

i can just see you in macbeth

when asked to explain the bloodstained

suit

he told the court that it was an

accumulation of two

or three years of blood from

patients the prosecutor showed back that

wouldn't that be a serious risk of

infection

to your patients to which buck

gave a long and nonsensical explanation

about how infection comes from the

doctor's

mouth and then dramatically illustrated

his explanation by wiping his

handkerchief over his mouth several

times he also threw a tantrum

some the railing and cried

that he had nothing to hide like a

little

\[ __ ] didn't he also try to claim

that the significant amount of

blood that was found in his house

down the stair railings and on the walls

and through all of his barn-like

straw could have naturally occurred

during

menstruation cycles what it was like no

no this is just normal from you know

bleeding women and \[ __ ]

what we read the same wikipedia

article i don't remember this being

mentioned

it's normal bloodshed from ovulation in

it i bleed

like a stabbed pig when i menstruate

buck roxton was executed by hanging

in 1937 and the following day

his confession was published in a sunday

newspaper

buck had instructed it to be published

only after his execution and he also

said that

if i get acquitted or win my appeal the

letter

is supposed to be returned to me

without being opened and at first i was

like which newspaper would

actually follow those instructions but i

guess

it was the 1930s it's a gentleman's

honorable code

yeah his confession was probably not

sincere in any way either but
