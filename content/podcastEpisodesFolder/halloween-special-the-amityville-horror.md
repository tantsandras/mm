Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

My role is mansplaining science. 

Yeah, yeah. And also mansplaining other things. \[Laughter]

You're foreign. I don't know what you understand.

Oh! I have an immigrant question, speaking of which...

See! These pop up so often that I'm like: "does she know what a potato peeler is? Of course she knows what a potato peeler is, she's scandinavian".

My question is, where does the phrase "Bob's your uncle" come from? I know what it means, but where does it come from? 

Somebody's whose uncle was Bob? \[Laughter] I don't even know what it means. It just means good, right? 

It means like: "gets the job done", kind of, doesn't it? Or...

I guess, yeah. 

Yeah, I don't know its origins, I'm not an entomologist. Etymologist, sorry. Entomologist is someone who studies insects. 

Yeah. I knew that as well. Should we start? 

How do you know what entomologist and etymologist are, but you don't know what potato peeler is?

The only word that I can spell a hundred percent of the time, every time, is dyslexic. Which...

That's pretty good going, because that's a nice bastardisation of Greek and Latin.

Yeah, there's weird letters in it.

\[Music]

It's Wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders and I'm your host Sandra.

I'm your host Joe, and we've got a new member!

Oh my god! True crime aficionado Lee Popey. Hello!

Hi. I was gonna try to leave it as long as possible and then wait, and then be like: "do you want me speak now?" as you were speaking. But we're on the clock. 

That is true. 

I mean that's pretty much how all of our unedited introductions go. 

Yeah. Okay, so Lee is our best pal Jo's boyfriend. So it's a bit weird that we don't have Jo on the show but...

A separate Jo from the Joe that's on the show, I'd like to point out.

Yes, and also, Lee is more of a true crime fan I'm assuming? 

Thaaaaan? 

Than Jo. Than both Jo's.

Oh definitely. Yeah she hates... 

Than both of us, yeah.

She hates it when I try to commit true crimes.

How many have you got away with so far? 

I stole a really good kinder egg, like when I was younger.

I once stole a plastic grass cutter that my neighbor had. My neighbor was a dick, and then I stole her plastic toy grass clipper. Walked all the way to my house with it and then got extreme anxiety. I was like six years old. I was like: "I can't believe I've done this horrible thing".

I'm very confused. Do they not have lawn mowers where you come from?

Yeah, a lawn mower. It was a plastic lawn mower. 

Oh. I see, I see. Was it one of those ones that had like balls that jumped around on the top of it?

I have no idea, I can't remember it. I only remember the severity of my crime. And the anguish it cost me. Okay. This week we're doing another halloween special and the case that we're going to talk about is the Amityville Horror. I got my information from wikipedia, truTV.com, by Douglas B. Lynott, The New York Times, by Pranay Gupte and amityvillemurders.com.

I have so many that I don't remember any of them.

Okay. The sources are gonna be on our website: midweekmurders.netlify.app.

I also have a book called "the night the DeFeos died", by Ric Osuna. It looks like tuna but instead of a T it's an O and an S. I don't know what that name is. 

Osuna. We can just assuma...\[Laughter]

Oh good lord, this is gonna be a long night.

Okay. So on the 13th of November 1970, Ronald "Butch" DeFeo junior entered Henry's Bar in Amityville Long Island at approximately 6.30 p.m and shouted: "you got to help me, I think my mother and father are shot". Isn't that a bit weird to say: "my mother and father"? I get bullied in Sweden because I called my mom and dad "mother and father" and they're like that's so weird. Isn't that weird? Maybe it wasn't in the 1970s.

Maybe not. And shootings aren't that weird there either in America. \[Laughter]

Butch and a small group of people went to his home address at 112 Ocean Avenue, not far away from where the bar was, and at 6.35 a 9-1-1 call is made. Joe Jeswit is the one who made the phone call, and the operator asked Joe: "what's the problem sir?". He answered: "it's a shooting". The operator says: "there's a shooting? Anybody hurt?".

The ones that got shot would be my first thought.

Oh shit, wait. I got a pop-up from Zoom.

It said that you have unlimited minutes now. 

Yeah.

Well that's good, we're gonna need them. \[Laughter]

And then it says: "what's the problem sir?", Joe says: "it's a shooting". Operator says: "there's a shooting? Anybody hurt?, Joe says: "huh?". "Anybody hurt?", "yeah it's uh... everybody's dead", "what do you mean everybody's dead?". "I don't know what happened, kid come running into the bar, he says everybody in the family was killed and we came down here". And in some sources it says that Joe Jeswit is his friend, but I'm guessing he's not, because he says: "some kid" or "kid come running into the bar" kind of sounds like they don't know each other.

I think they know of each other from the bar, it sounds like he frequented that place a lot. 

Yeah. So he guesses there are four shot people in the house, but when the police arrives they find six murder victims. Ronald DeFeo Sr. (44) and Louise DeFeo (42); and four of the DeFeo children: Dawn (18), Allison (13), Marc (12), and John Matthew 9 years old. They had been shot with a .35 calibre Marlin rifle. The parents were shot twice, and the children were killed with a single shot. So a bit of background to why this might have happened is that Ronald DeFeo Sr had come into some money working at his father-in-law’s Buick dealership and the family had moved into the large house by the Amityville river. But Ronald Sr was abusive towards his family, and the abuse had taken it’s toll on Ronald Jr, or Butch as I'm hereby gonna call him because it's a bit confusing with both Ronalds, who as a teenager would no longer be easy victim as he had grown into a bigger man and would fight back. To try to control the sons temper, the DeFeo parents tried to buy Butch’s obedience which often didn’t work, and then I said: "surprise, surprise!". At the age of 17 he was no longer allowed to attend school as his drug problem had become apparent. He would often use heroin and LSD and had at a party pointed a loaded rifle at a friend of his. This friend just left the party and then the next day he was like: "why did you leave the party so soon?", he was like: "you pointed a loaded gun at me. Duh".

And he's like: "it's America" and he said: "oh yeah".

"Fair enough, no hard feelings mate".

I like this anti-american stuff because the Russian bots will fucking lap it up man. \[Laughter]

We have mostly American listeners now, but we're probably not gonna... 

Not anymore, no.

Vote Biden.

So Butch got a job at his grandfathers Buick dealership but rarely turned up to do any work, and would still get paid every week. At one point his parents had an argument during which Butch came into the room, pointed a rifle at his father and said “Leave that woman alone. I'm going to kill you, you fat fuck! This is it". He proceeded to pull the trigger, at which the gun miraculously malfunctioned, and Butch just calmly walked out of the room. Nobody called the police. 

It was also at this point that Ronald found God.

Oh yeah. 

What?

Ronald senior. Yeah, seriously. This is in a couple of sources. He attributes this point as him becoming religious and finding God, because obviously he was staring death down the barrel of a gun, literally. Like totally literally. And was saved, so it must have been God's will, obviously. 

So two weeks before the murders, Butch was supposed to deposit a large check from the car dealership at the bank, but chose to stage a robbing. In which he pretended to get robbed by a friend who he then split the money with. 

Smart.

His father knew that Butch had stolen the money, and called the police. The police questioned Butch, who was a right prick about the whole thing, I said. There was a lot of information... 

Was that a quote in The New York Times? 

No, I just summarised it because there's a lot of like: "oh, he fought this, he did that, he was..." 

Sounds like an 1800's gentleman, "he was a right prick I said".

Bly Manor.

"Tally ho, what, what. Now let's move on". 

Oh god. Speaking of Bly Manor, the lady that's supposed to be the gardener but old... 

Yeah, the narrator. She sounds like Dick Van Dyke, "well alright, I know it's not my story to tell, right. But..." 

Even I could tell...

"But I'm gonna do it anyway". 

Oh god. Right prick about the whole thing. So on the Friday before the murders he was supposed to go to the police station to look at mug-shots in order to help solving the in air quotes, robbery, but he didn’t show up. This lead to another argument between him and his father, at which Butch again threatened to kill him. Which was witnessed by the people at the car dealership, I'm guessing. 

I'm starting to think Butch might have some issues. 

Yeah? Oh ja, maybe. So the day before the murders, Butch dosed the family dinner with barbiturates. In the early morning on the 14th of November, around three o'clock, Butch went into his parents room and shot his father two times. His mother woke up, at which point he proceeded to shoot her as well, two times. After that he went into the room of his two younger brothers and shot them both in the head. The rest of the family had still not woken up, and this might or might not be true. He then went to his sisters bedroom, at which point Allison had woken up, he shot her and then shot his other sister Dawn.

Just as a light spoiler for things to come, a lot of what you just said is completely inaccurate.

Is it though? 

Yeah, I have the book in front of me which has the crime scene photos and the little brother was definitely not shot in the head. 

No it was Dawn that was shot in the head.

Oh sorry, yeah. 

Also, I'm glad that you said about that he drug their things, because I'm sure Joe as the like man who knows the science might tell you that that is completely false and that they weren't drugged.

I'm not sure what they weren't though. 

I can tell you what happened, but I just want to hear what you guys are saying first. 

On Wikipedia it says that they were, and then I also found an article from 1974 which said that they were. I couldn't find...

Whereas I found an article that said... That directly quoted the autopsy report, basically the tox report came back clean. There was nothing that shouldn't have been in their systems at time of death. 

Okay. The thing is, I really looked, I couldn't find the autopsy reports. So I'm not sure, but I'm not sure that he didn't either. 

It's possible that he used a sedative type drug that would have had a short half-life which, for the non-scientific listeners, is basically the time it takes in the body for the drug dosage to reduce by half. So if he had given them something that has a short half-life, then it could have cleared their system by the time the autopsy was conducted. But as soon as they died, all of the metabolic pathways that would have been responsible for breaking down the drugs would have stopped. So even if he was using something with a short half-life, you still would have expected to find something in there at time of death, if you're expecting that drug to work to keep them asleep while he rampages around the house. 

But for example, would it be possible that he as he said in his confession, the first one, that he drugged them at dinner time the day before and at three o'clock in the morning most of that would have worn off?

Yeah. But then, without any drug circulating in their system to keep them asleep, the report of the rifle would have woken the other family members. And to put it in perspective, the gun shot can be heard within a mile radius.

It woke the dog up that was outside. Because I think this is how he got convicted, because he let the dog out and then brought the dog back in and they were like: "well it's premeditated if you did that". 

And also that's the only thing the neighbours reported hearing, was the barking of the dog. So after the first gunshot the dog would be going, which could have masked the rest of the gunshots. But this is one of the unsolved mysteries of the whole case, is how the whole family stayed where they were in their beds, in situ, while whoever murdered them... 

Except for Allison...

No, except for Dawn.

Dawn was the one who wasn't in her bed.

No, Dawn was the only one that wasn't murdered in her bed.

Okay and Allison... I read like several different reports on this and Allison was said to have woken up. So they knew that Allison was shot in the head like staring at the barrel. 

I don't think Allison was shot in the head.

She was shot in the head. 

Okay, then it still would have been in bed.

Yeah, maybe yeah. She could have been shot in the bed, but they said that the two people who they could conclude definitely were awake during this, was the mother and Allison.

Did either of you come across the second gun in the reports? 

Yeah. I guess we'll get to it, but maybe we should do it now. Some people said that there might have been a second gun, because of the fact that most of the people were asleep.

Well, I don't know if it showed up in the autopsy that the mother, particularly, would have had a bullet in her from a pistol and not from a rifle.

They said that all of the eight gunshots were from the same rifle, except for one which they couldn't conclude definitely, because it was too damaged. 

Interestingly when this went to court, to prosecute Butch, the prosecution said definitively that all eight bullets were from the same weapon. The ballistics expert was 100% sure, beyond any reasonable doubt, that all of these bullets came from the same gun. The prosecution debated that, they weren't convinced. So they didn't rule out the possibility of a second weapon being used...No sorry, the defence. The prosecution were 100% sure it was all from the same rifle. 

Yeah. I looked far and wide for the autopsy report, couldn't find it.

You are not going to be able to find it, because Amityville police will not let anyone get their hands on it. 

Okay, okay. 

Because they may or may not be super fucking corrupt.

Ooooh. Well, there were differing reports about the crime scene photos, I didn't look at them myself. I don't want to, I don't think. 

I'm looking at them now and they're not nice to look at. But the crime scene photos that are in this book back up the story that's in this book quite heavily.

Okay, because what I could discern from all the differing reports was that the only ones that they could prove were awake was the mother and Allison. Dawn I've heard differing reports about, but she might have been asleep, but she wasn't placed... 

Did you watch any of the documentaries or just read the stuff?

I did not watch the documentaries because I heard... The guy, his name was Katzenbach, no?

That rings a bell. The lawyer? 

No. I don't know what he is, but he's made three documentaries about the case and people are saying that he is not to be trusted. At all. 

If it's Jeffrey Katzenberg, I'm fairly certain, I might be wrong about this. That he was the lawyer of Ronald DeFeo and then he, with the Lutz's, sat down and wrote the book The Amityville Horror.

No that was Waber, wasn't it? Or Webber?

Oh yeah.

Maybe, yeah. 

You're right in that there was definitely...The defence lawyer, over multiple bottles of wine, came up with the whole haunting story.

Because in a few of the documentaries, they're all pretty set on that Ronnie did everything. And then there is another documentary that I saw where Ronnie said that an angel with black hands handed him the gun. The quote-unquote angel was not an angel, it was a his older sister Dawn wearing gloves because she didn't want her fingerprints on the gun.

I think we're skipping a bit ahead now.

Yeah.

Wait, I have another question about the forensics. 

Hold on, let me put on my monocle.

If they were drugged, and the drug wasn't like enough to be in their system at the point where the autopsy was made, would the children be more susceptible to that than the parents? 

Yes. So a lot of sedatives will work determined on the size of the person. So if he gave the same dose to his entire family, you'd find that the children would be asleep faster, deeper, and for longer than the parents would. 

Yeah. So hypothetically, because it's reported in the confession, in the newspaper at the time and on Wikipedia, they might have been drugged?

I'm not convinced. 

I know the answer, I know that they weren't drugged. I'm just flicking through the book now to see if there's pictures of Ronnie DeFeo after he gave his quote-unquote confession, because he was horrifically beaten by the police. Because they made up loads of stuff, there was more than one killer and there was four people involved and only one of them went to prison for it. 

The thing that they could prove is that before going to the bar, or, before going to work. Sorry. Butch showered, trimmed his beard, got dressed and collected his blood-soaked clothing along with the rifle and put the evidence in a pillowcase. He then drove to Brooklyn where his place of work was, the car dealership, and disposed of the pillowcase in a storm drain. After which he showed up to work and clocked in at 6 am. At work he made a big show about calling the house several times and commented several times about nobody answering. He then left work at noon and went to his girlfriend's house and continued the charade there, by calling his house and commenting again on nobody answering. Then he and his girlfriend went to Butch's friend's Bobby's house, where butch repeated the same scene of calling his house and then commenting on nobody answering. He proceeded to hang out with his friends, they took heroin and then went to the bar, where he said that he was going home as his repeated calls had been met with no answer. He returned to the bar a couple of minutes after, so I'm guessing like 10 minutes or more maybe, shouting for help. And now we're at the start of the story again. When the police showed up at the house Butch was sobbing, and told them that Louis Falini, a mob hitman, had done the murders. Because he said that Louis Falini had been living with them for a while, and he knew that they had like money and stuff hidden in the basement, stuff like that. After which he casually asked the police how to go about collecting life insurance. The police believed Butch's story at first, but then after finding the rifle boxes and getting information about the staged robbery they began to suspect Butch of being the murderer. Butch had also stated that he had heard his brother, and seen his brother's wheelchair outside of the toilet, at 4.00 a.m. And the detectives who knew that the family had been sleeping while shot, and also that the time of death had been around three a.m, didn't believe that the crimes had happened after Butch left for work. So then after many lies about being threatened by Falini and some other dude, the police pressed him on the details that didn't add up. Press him on the details might have been physical if I'm getting your photo thing right?

Yeah, I mean there's also there was a second gun. In the confession Butch says it wasn't a second gun but there was a second gun, which is where the confusion comes from. So the girlfriend of Butch, he actually married her in prison, her name was Geraldine.

No, that's another girlfriend. 

Well he's married to someone called Geraldine and through her they managed to get hold of the court documents, which they have in here, which have massive chunks of stuff that are redacted. And he has spoken to Ronnie himself about the story and the story that Butch tells matches up with the crime scene photos. One very specific one is the door to the bedroom of the parents is covered in blood, but if they were shot in bed, how was their blood spatter on the other side of the room?

Okay. 

And it's because he wasn't in bed when he was shot.

Who? The father? 

The father, yeah. 

I'm not sure about the second gun, because they did link up all of the bullets to one gun. 

Ah. But they didn't. Like Joe was saying, other people were saying... I don't think this matches up. And also, the police lied a lot and have redacted a lot of the stuff in that... Like they just put black lines through loads of the evidence because they wanted to nail this guy and just get it over and done with. Because they were lazy 70s police officers. 

Yeah. I would agree that it was only the prosecution team at court that said that there was only one weapon involved.

Okay. 

The defense team tried to argue that not all of the bullets came from the same gun, but obviously the prosecution managed to convince the jury enough to say that it was all from one weapon.

I would say, I'm quite sure that Butch did it. Not that I'm 100% sure that he was alone doing it, but I'm 100% sure that he was involved.

Oh he was involved, definitely. Like if the book is correct, which is from Butch and crime scene photos and testimonies and all the stuff of the night. If it is, he a hundred percent killed his mom and his dad but he did not kill the rest of his family members, minus Dawn. And that's why she wasn't in bed and why she was also shot at such close range.

Well I'm not 100% sure that Dawn had anything to do with it either, because I feel like that is placing blame on the victim.

No, there's evidence to say that Dawn could have been involved.

I know about the gun powder.

Well yeah, the gun powder to start with. On her hands and on her nightgown, of unexploded gunpowder. The house was under surveillance, and this wasn't admissible evidence in court...

Oh she was seen with the black gloves on, right? Walking to the basement? 

Yeah. The police were concerned that Butch was smuggling drugs, or dealing drugs or had sincere involvement with drugs, which obviously he did because he was getting shit-faced more and more often. 

When the police said they saw it, did they see her carrying the gun? I can't remember.

Apparently they saw her getting into a car with the gun and disposing of it in the location where it was found. The police that were staking out the house saw Dawn in a hooded like parka coat with gloves on, walking into the house. Which matches the description that Butch gave of this spirit that visited him while he was high off his tits. They then saw Dawn leaving the house with the rifle, getting into a car and driving, I think, to a place called north point.

That's the water, like where they dropped the gun in the water? 

Yeah. It's a dock, basically. Which is where they recovered the Marlin rifle. So the theory is: she went in and killed the parents because of the abuse that the whole family were under. Then either like lost her mind or whatever, and killed the younger siblings. The plan between Dawn and Butch was to only kill the parents which is why, when she returned after disposing of the gun, Butch killed her. Which also explains why she wasn't in bed. That's supported by the scenes of crimes officers finding blood spatter on floorboards and skirting boards outside of her bedroom and why her headboard behind her bed was completely clean, but basically, her head was destroyed. It also supports the theory of the defense lawyers that multiple weapons were included, because she would have had to have been killed by a different weapon by Butch because she had already disposed of the rifle that she used to kill the rest of the family.

Was she placed on a bed after she was killed? 

Yes. She was recovered from her bed, but that wasn't her site of death. 

No, okay. That, I read about. She was shot behind her left ear, no? I read...

I'm flipping through the book now to see if the autopsy things are in it. It shows where their bodies were positioned when they were found, but I don't think it shows their autopsy stuff in here. But yeah, she was shot at point blank range with that rifle, so.

She was shot with the rifle? 

Yeah, she didn't dispose of the rifle. Ronnie disposed of the rifle. So the version I have is that Butch, Dawn, Bobby and somebody called Argie... Basically, Butch and Dawn wanted to get rid of the parents, they'd had had fucking enough. Like, they were sick of their shit. Dawn was just like: "you're a fucking pussy, you're never gonna do anything about it" and then she left and came back with the rifle and was wearing black gloves and was like: "let's just kill them now". And then they hatched the plan, and the plan was that Butch was gonna go kill the family... Sorry, the mum and the dad. And while he was doing this, Dawn went to the brothers and was just like: "you're gonna hear some noise but just fucking stay in bed. Whatever you do, do not leave your room". Before he went into his parents room he went into Allison's room, because Butch's favorite sister was Allison, and he said to Allison: "stay in your room, whatever you do. There's a burglar in the house and if you hear any noise, just stay in your room". And then Butch and Bobby went into the parents room, shot the dad in the back which woke him up and didn't kill him, the mum sat upright and was like: "oh my god". And apparently, Butch was like: "I've had it with her" and just shot her. The dad gets out of bed and runs at him and he shoots him dead in the hallway, which is why there's blood splatter up the door and on the wall, and he falls down dead. While this is happening, Bobby fires his gun at the mum, and then Ronnie like slaps it out of his hand and is like: "what are you doing?! That's my mum. Leave it". Bobby freaks out and runs away...

And this is the same friend that he then went to after work, before going to the pub? 

Yeah. Bobby freaked out and ran away. Because the plan was to get the kids out of the house and take them to the grandparents, and say that there'd been a robbery and and someone's been hurt. So he was like: "I'm gonna go get Bobby. You deal with the kids". And he's running around trying to find Bobby, and then Argie appears in a car and he's like: "mate, your sister's gone nuts. She pointed a gun at my head". And then fired into the ceiling of his car, and there's a bullet hole in the car. And he's like: "she's gone nuts. You need to deal with that". So he left Bobby and went back to the house. He spoke to his brothers and was like: "stay in bed, stay in bed". One of them was desperate for a piss, the one that had a broken leg, Johnny. And he was just like: "piss the bed or piss in a can", and he's like: "I'm not going to piss the bed". So he had to run downstairs, empty a can of coffee for him, come back up, give it to him to piss in, get rid of it. Checked on his younger sister. And then Dawn was playing her music really loudly upstairs and singing, and she'd clearly taken drugs. And he went up there and was just like: "you need to sober up. You have to get the kids and you have to take them to the grandparents. Remember the plan". Then he ran back downstairs and tried to move his dad back into the bed, but realized he couldn't lift him by himself. So he had to go find Bobby. So he ran out, managed to come across Bobby, brought him back to the house. But then when they went into the house he checked on his brothers and saw that they were dead. And then he checked on his sister and saw that she was dead. And he ran upstairs to see Dawn, was like: "what the hell did you do!", and she was just like: "oh, it's just easier this way, if we just do it this way". He allegedly wrestled her, because she pulled the gun on him, and in the wrestling fired the gun at point blank range into her head. He managed to get Bobby to help him move the body into the bed. And Bobby had dropped his gun in the blood of his dad. And then he took it with him, and some of his clothes, to get rid of. He was like: "take your clothes, take the gun and burn them. Get fucking rid of them". Then he got rid of Bobby. Then he got rid of his clothes, and did the cutting of his beard, and had a shower and stuff. And then he left. And then realized that he had left the fucking gun behind. So he went back and got the gun and took it and chucked it in that river.

But they did find the rifle in the storm drain?

No. They found his clothes in the storm drain. The rifle was found in... By.. At north point in the the dock. You wouldn't be able to hide a rifle in a pillow case, it's too small. It'd just be a fucking rifle sticking out of a bit of fabric. You'd be like: "there's a rifle over there!".

Yeah. 

The rifle was chucked in the river.

Okay. But if... Wait. \[Laughter] So Butch said that he was on heroin at the police investigation, the police like beatings and stuff?

Yeah.

Mescaline. 

Okay. And Dawn's autopsy said that she wasn't on drugs? No? 

I don't actually know. Joe, do you know?

I don't know. I can only assume that because she was deceased, she was included in the general "there was no unusual toxicology" to the autopsy report. 

I'm not sure about this either. 

Well the thing is, it's like... Like I said, it matches the crime scene photos. And obviously the little brother is not shot in the head, he's shot in the back. We also have to take into account that in many years since Ronnie DeFeo junior, who is still alive, has said multiple different stories. Including, when the fucking Amityville horror happened, that a ghost made him do it. 

Yeah. Which I think is lies, obviously. 

Oh definitely, yeah. 

I thought that was the most plausible one. \[Laughter]

But also that he has blamed it first on his mother, and then he blamed it on Dawn. 

Just to let you know, so I've just found a page that has a picture of what was found in the sewer and it's like bullet casings, the boxes for the bullets, and the case for the rifle. 

Okay. 

Yeah. Which was like a leather case, so you could fold it out.

Okay, yeah. And the box of the rifle was found at the crime scene? Yeah. 

Yeah, yeah.

In the house. So the rifle wasn't in the pillowcase, no.

No, the rifle was in the river. 

Yeah. But he did pick up the shell casings?

Yes. 

Yes. 

Smart. 

Yeah, but how smart, I don't know. The bullets were still there, even though you say that it's bullets from two different guns. I'm not sure.

Well, possibly. But also, leaving the shell cases is irrefutable evidence, so...

I just found another picture in here

which is like there's a hairbrush on the

floor which

ronnie claimed dawn had thrown at bobby

and unless they'd shown him crime scene

photos how the \[ __ ] did he know that

brush was there

how many gun shells was in that

pillowcase

here we go i can see one two three

four five six seven eight nine

shell casings so they're saying that the

parents were shot

there should only be eight well there's

i can see

with my eyes that there's nine of them

are they definitely only the casing and

not the whole shell

it's really hard to tell from the photo

because there's like a strap

over them so some of them are covered

with the strap so i can't see if it's

the complete thing

oh they've got a strap on i get it if

there

are eight shell casings or nine

that would point to the single gun

theory yeah not necessary necessary

i'm sending you the picture of that

right now not the crime not the bloody

crime scene photos but of the

uh what they found in the sewer on your

instagram

so you can see for yourself what i mean

i can count nine

so you got two eyes i have two

i think that this theory about dawn

being one of the

perpetrators is a bit hard for me to

swallow

because she's dead and i feel like

there's been countless accounts

of people killing their family it's

mostly men

i mean it's very similar to that guy who

killed his whole family instead of

getting a divorce

yeah they mostly blame other people in

the family especially women

and i feel like he has also

tried to blame his mother for the death

of the

children for the siblings he also has

said

and he's quoted in this book as saying

it's her fault anyway because she

allowed

the husband to be that much of an

\[ __ ]

yeah but he blames her even not for the

physical

shooting but he blames her for it anyway

yeah but he also

tried to blame the physical shooting on

his mother

and i feel like while i can't understand

the anger of that

the resentment he was a giant platt

who didn't show up for work and got paid

for work they bought him a boat for

\[ __ ] sake

and he's like oh but abuse cannot be

bought for money

i get that but i wouldn't necessarily

want to believe and that might be my own

bias

i mean it's fair enough and also he has

changed his story

so many times but we could all

conclusively agree that the ghost stuff

was made up

\[Laughter]

speaking of the ghost stuff i have some

notes about the ghost stuff that i

thought was funny

go for it do we want to do that okay so

the ghost

is the best bit george and kathy looks

moved into the house in 1976

and some of the claims from them are

that

a porcelain lion left from the corner of

the

room and bit george in the ankle

george also saw a vision of

ronnie defeo his head floating in the

cellar

who is not dead george

and kathy said that they saw

the burn depression of a demonic hooded

figure

in the fireplace cathy apparently

levitated above their bed

and saw herself as an elderly woman

the toilets was backed up with black

smelly ooze which i feel like

is my normal stew no no no

no wait on that one it wasn't that the

toilets were backed up with smelly ooze

it was that the porcelain of the toilet

turned black which would be better for

the stains i guess

but and also the walls of the house were

covered with green slime which i'm like

who you're gonna call ghostbusters

so one of the things you listed there

was that kathy

had a vision of herself as an old lady

she died of a disease that made her age

really quickly

that's not true is it not true she died

of emphysema but it made her look like

she had

aged loads apparently there is no

documented history of

what was formerly called emphysema is

now called chronic obstructive pulmonary

disorder

causing premature aging basically copd

is a buildup of mucus

or whatever in your lungs which just

causes

chronic coughing it can be terminal you

can die from it

but this was one of the things where one

of the psychics

that investigated the house was like oh

yes

kathy looked she saw herself in mirror

and saw herself

old and then she died of a disease that

made her old

no she didn't she died of a chronic lung

condition that has no medical background

in premature aging

at all a notable psychic that did go

into the house or two of them were the

warrens

aka the people from the country and also

my favorite thing is that the little

girl of the lotsies

oh is that the demon pig she had

allegedly

an invisible friend that was a demon pig

yeah and there's a bit in a movie that

as a child traumatized me where

a mum comes into the room and just

before she walks in the rocking chair is

rocking and as she walks in the room it

stops

and uh she's like oh what are you doing

to the door sitting up she's like oh mom

you just scared jodie and she's like oh

yeah

like where did jody go and she's like oh

she went out the window and then the mum

goes to the window to shut it and sees

these eyes staring back at her

so this little girl would draw pictures

of jodie

it looks like a pig that's where they

got the it looked like a pig because

but we all know what children drawing

looks like it's not quite right

that was shown to a neighbor and a

neighbor was like oh that's jody and

they were like how do you know that

and he's like oh that's the fat cat that

like lives in the street

which makes sense because cat's eyes are

reflective so

that potentially could have happened i

feel like there was some potential

creepy stuff that did happen and then

they just when they had that drinking

session with that \[ __ ] guy they just

blew up a load of \[ __ ]

i can corroborate that with what i read

in the it was

widely known that this particular

persian

cat would sit on that windowsill and

look in at the window

and because it was a fat cat it was

nicknamed

the pig

\[Laughter]

so i think the little girl would have

obviously heard people referring to it

as the pig it would have stuck in her

subconscious

and that's where the whole drawing and

haunting came from

there's a bit in the film where george

is coming back to the house and looks up

and just sees a giant pig monster in the

window

apparently there's a hundred and sixteen

errors

in the book that is it in the original

book the hardback cover

has more errors than the softback

because they fixed some of them when

they

did the second releasing one of my

favorite of the errors

in the book other than the demon pig is

that

george lutz claimed that there were

mysterious hoof marks in the snow

someone just like googled or whatever

the alternative was

in the 70s went to the library i don't

know whatever

microfiche on

alta vista do you remember that search

engine no

i remember oh the web alta vista was the

best for porn

anyway

so yeah the hoof marks in the snow on

that particular day that george reported

them

there was no snow that whole week

beautiful

one of my favorite ones was that the

priest when he drove home after being

told to get out

that the bonnet of his car opened and

like went over the windshield and it

caused him to crash

but that model of car that he drives the

bonnet opens the other way

\[Laughter]

that was mentioned as well because they

said that they had flies in there and

unseasonable things allegedly something

i saw they were like

yeah it was a \[ __ ] crime scene and

they'd left all the windows shut and

like they're eating on like

yeah the heating was left on and

obviously the crime scene wasn't

reported for

24 hours afterwards or something like

that so that's like

the perfect opportunity for maggots and

flies to

be created and then while the lutz's

were sitting down

with the lawyer weber they were like oh

yeah

a swarm of flies in some of the bedrooms

yeah that's a really good idea

the other thing is the slime so george

and kathy

obviously said that their walls were

white

is it the fingerprint stuff exactly it's

the fingerprint powder that would have

been used by the forensics teams

that again came through in this drunken

wine session with the lawyer

they just they picked up on these tiny

little things

and just went crazy with them i love

that it was like oh they moved in and

then they stayed there for like 28 days

and then they never went back and it's

like

why would they lie and it's like because

they made millions when they sold the

book

actually when they sold the book they

only made three hundred thousand

i mean yeah i mean

1970s money 300 000 is a hell of a lot

the author of the book made millions

yeah

but the contract that they signed with

him they got a raw deal on which i feel

like

just serves them right yeah good you're

\[ __ ] cashing in on a literal tragedy

yeah and then another one oh she's back

speaking of green slime i had have you

been here since then

yeah oh you came back stealthy

asparagus risotto for dinner

my pee did not smell nice you got black

porcelain now

my other favorite debunkings of the

haunting

was that they claimed a window would

slam shut yeah when there was nobody

near it and there was like no wind

it would just randomly slam shut

whenever someone entered the room

and then some surveyors went in and

found

that the frame of the window wasn't

constructed

properly and neither was the wall that

the window

was sitting in so when you walked into a

certain

spot in the room you stood on a

floorboard

which sunk a little bit which had enough

of an

impact to tilt the frame of the window

like a degree which was enough to slam

shut the window

yeah and they they proved it like they

lifted up the window

stood in that spot and bang down when

the window

i've just sent sandra a pitcher which is

my favorite picture from the

quote-unquote seance that they took

there

which is just a \[ __ ] picture of it oh

yeah

the demon boy is what it's called i

think it's a person

potentially wearing glasses looking at

the camera as the flash

goes off yes yes i've seen this picture

and so many people are like well this is

like

irrefutable evidence that it's haunted

there were no children

in the house at the time that we did the

seance and you can clearly see this is a

child with demonic glowing eyes

if you actually zoom in on a high

quality resolution of that picture

which appreciably isn't that easy to

find because it was taken in the 70s

you can see the frames of his glasses

yeah you can yeah

and that person is kneeling down this is

a member

of the media that was there for the

seance to record it

it's just a random man who's wearing

glasses i will give props to the

conjuring too which is a film that sucks

so \[ __ ] bad but in the opening where

they're in the army of your house and

the ghosts have those glowing eyes i

really appreciate that a bit

i've always thought that you could see

the glasses like obviously that house

still stands

yeah it's a real pain in the ass for

people who live there so they've had to

alter the front of the house so that it

doesn't

look like it doesn't have the iconic

windows anymore because they've altered

yeah

but it's still at 112 ocean avenue emily

real \[ __ ] new york so it's not like

it's hard to fly no

they changed the address yeah yeah but

like still

it's the in the same space it's in the

same location

oh we've changed the address so the

house next to it is one one one

and then it goes one one one b and then

it's like

one month this looks like that \[ __ ]

really famous house

i kind of did you read the uh dead

indian chief

\[Laughter]

it was buried on an ancient indian

burial ground and then someone was like

but they don't bury them next to water

though that's like their whole thing

the other thing was they spoke to the

montuckette tribe

which are the natives that are closest

to that region

and they were like we've got no burial

ground in

amateurville we've never had a burial

ground

in ameterville and capturing people's

souls

and using them as a vessel to cause evil

is not within our philosophy

so it's definitely not us and then the

shinnecock tribe which are

like 70 miles away but also the second

closest the house was built in 1924

so for a native american tribal chief

to have been buried in that plot of land

needed to have happened

like relatively early

in 1658 two-thirds of the shinnecock

tribe's population were wiped out by

smallpox

oh yeah but where did they fall dead eh

all on one one twelve be

all in one one one b

c drive can you imagine if it was like

one one

ocean avenue one one three ocean avenue

and one one two jfk drive

i can't find it completely lost

this is a bit not funny but i thought it

was quite funny on the 911 call

the whole call is just them trying to

figure out what his name is

and then they were like where is it he

was like this

road they were like where is that he was

like this is the \[ __ ] road

i was gonna say the one you were saying

earlier when he called up and he's like

there's been a shooting there's been a

shooting

yeah there has been a shoot and then

they've all been shot what do you mean

all of them

is anyone harmed yes it's a \[ __ ]

shooting

i opened with that that's just like a

third or like a fourth of the phone call

the whole phone call is just

him being more and more annoyed

by them not listening i had a similar

situation i had to call the police once

because i got jumped with a friend of

mine by

like 13 or 14 13 or 14 year olds

um wait and you were the nick helm joke

wait are you kind of were in that age

yeah like a year older but there was

like way more of them

so i called the police i was like me and

my friend have been jammed with being

atta i managed to escape

obviously because i'm super fast

\[Laughter]

\[Music]

i ran away i'm fine don't worry about me

i was like i'm in market square in hemel

hempstead town center

and they were like where's that i'm like

this is the geographical location i

can't give you any more details on this

unless you want like longitude

longitudinal latitude

like market square hemel hempstead town

center and they're like i can't put that

in the system i don't know where that is

i'm like i'm a hundred meters away from

the police station

in the time it's taken me to tell you

where my \[ __ ] address was

i could have just ran to the \[ __ ]

police station

send me some local \[ __ ] police

because why didn't you obviously i ran

in the opposite direction
