  midweek murders contains graphic and
  explicit content
  listener discretion is advised
  [Laughter]
  you're listening to midweek murders and
  that means that it's time to talk about
  crime
  this is joe hello and this is sandra
  hi
  that was fucking awkward
  it's better to say i'm sandra and this
  is hello i'm joe it's not
  because you're basically introducing it
  as
  uh let's talk about crime uh i'm sandra
  and this is
  joe like how how do i come into that i
  can't be
  upbeat and preppy and like hey listeners
  i'm joe
  it's just like and this is joe
  obviously as it has been for the past
  four weeks like
  the fuck do you expect it to be frank
  oh it's true
  this week's introduction is jazz
  [Music]
  this week we're going to talk about the
  snoopy murder which was a
  very scandalous moment
  for the swedish national news
  i guess like i was quite young when it
  happened
  and i remember andre when you were born
  75
  well metaphorically yes but
  at that time i think i was 14
  does that make sense yeah it does i was
  14
  and i remember it being on the news and
  i was like
  what in the hell because
  sweden is one of the most secular
  countries in the world and for
  us to have like okay let's start from
  the beginning
  sorry i got mine it's a good place to
  start
  i got my information from mission
  investigate or update
  they had a docu-series about the
  case which came out quite recently
  and also wikipedia wikiwiki
  also got my what the fuck is it
  information
  i thought you were gonna say a swedish
  word so i was prepared to help you
  yeah i got my information from wikipedia
  and also my brain
  so in the 10th
  of january 2004
  alexandra fossmo was shot
  but they didn't know that at first
  because the one that
  called the police was the neighbor who
  was chopped two times
  but survived and his name was daniel now
  i can't say it in swedish
  or english
  sorry i completely pooh pooch your
  lovely pronunciation there okay daniel
  linde
  and the english listeners we're just
  gonna call him daniel
  daniel yeah but first
  nobody know knew what the trouble
  i've seen
  [Music]
  my sorrow
  [Music]
  [Laughter]
  so daniel calls the police and
  the police arrest storas ventson
  at her childhood home in
  [Applause]
  no where they were shot like in
  the more southern the power part of
  sweden sorry is iron
  fine excuse me and
  um quite early on
  they understand that sarah
  or sarah thinks that she
  is on a mission to save her soul
  and they were like oh oh this smells
  like
  indoctrination or brainwashing or
  whatever you want to call it they kind
  of keyed into the fact
  that she sounded not of sound mind
  when they arrested her so
  during the prosecution
  of sarah they understand
  that she has been getting these
  anonymous messages on her phone
  from what she thinks is
  god or somebody working for god
  and that obviously sounded
  crazy all of the messages that she
  said that she had gotten were deleted
  but with the technology that they had at
  the time
  they managed to get those
  messages from her phone so she had
  turned
  her phone and she had say that she had
  done
  the murder of alexandra fossmo and also
  the attempted murder of daniel but
  from the text messages that they were
  able to
  retrieve even though they were deleted
  there was hundreds of messages
  saying that what you need to do
  for god is murder alexandra
  and the murderer daniel
  so this was very confusing at the time
  i remember when it when it came on the
  news and everything and i
  and everyone in sweden was like what in
  the hell
  but it unearthed
  what do you call it like it came to
  light this whole
  fucked up situation unearthed is fine
  revealed
  yeah it revealed uncovered it uncovered
  this very weird sect in
  canopy which is very close to stockholm
  and a part of the county where a lot of
  people go to study
  and what it revealed about that
  sect which they wouldn't call themselves
  at the time
  in that community they quickly on earth
  that one of the key players in
  that church was a woman called
  Åsa Waldau who
  said that she was the bride of christ
  and the people engaged in that
  church also called her the bride of
  christ
  or the queen of heaven oh
  that's what it meant
  which is very very problematic
  in a very general kind of sense but
  in this particular congregation
  it was extremely problematic
  which wouldn't come out until later
  but sarah was prosecuted by the
  state and also they
  tracked those text messages that she had
  gotten
  from air quotes god to
  her minister or pastor
  helge fossmo or fossmo
  no i said in english twice fuck it
  he in himself turned out to be extremely
  problematic
  because he had murdered
  his first wife on the 18th december of
  1999
  reportedly yeah but well allegedly
  but i think he did do that yeah but you
  can't
  for legal reasons say that he did it if
  he hasn't been prosecuted for it
  well they they did kind of like
  throw it out there the prosecution that
  he
  might have killed his first wife as well
  yeah but just trust me you can't legally
  say
  that he has killed his first wife you
  have to put in
  allegedly yeah yeah no i do trust you
  i just feel like i don't care because
  nobody listens to step for the bot
  look if we have to cite our sources
  then you can't accuse people of murder
  okay fine he was accused
  of his first wife's murder
  helly helen sorry
  so just say them in swedish it's fine
  the more you say them in swedish the
  more i'm going to be able to replicate
  the sounds
  okay helen because in 1999
  she was found dead in her bathtub
  with a toxic concentration of
  an opioid found in prescription
  painkillers
  that had been prescribed for
  helge fosmo and she also had
  a wound or a hole in her temple
  that at the time they thought that she
  had
  banged her head on the faucet
  of the bathtub
  i can hear you pouring beer i was gonna
  mute myself
  but then i thought you might need my
  input turns out
  i was just spending the whole time
  sassing you
  yeah you're wrong they did
  bring it up as the prosecution point and
  he was found
  not guilty yes so he wasn't prosecuted
  for it
  i'm gonna say you're misunderstanding me
  but i i i'm understanding you but the
  legal term of
  prosecution is to win your case against
  x y and z so if the charges were dropped
  because there was insufficient evidence
  or whatever
  then he hasn't been prosecuted for it oh
  okay i thought it was like you because
  at the time when she actually was
  allegedly
  murdered in 19 years
  in 1999. they
  just ruled it out as a accident
  accidental death yeah then they reopened
  it as
  a possible attempted murder or murder
  but there isn't sufficient evidence to
  charge him for it
  so that was all dropped and his prison
  time
  was for alexandra
  exactly
  but what is it called then like when
  it's
  when it's like charging
  yeah it's a charge for that
  crime well alleged crime
  he was he was sentenced
  obviously for conspiring
  to murder his second wife and
  his next-door neighbor which
  digging more into it his neighbor
  was a husband to a woman that he was
  having
  an affair with and sarah
  was on trial and did
  a full confession and told them all
  about
  how she got the gun and she was
  sentenced
  to institutional psychiatric care
  and that makes sense to me because
  after actually digging into this case
  which i did from a very early age
  which is obviously concerning
  but i was very interested in what
  happened it turns out that sarah
  she was called the nanny in swedish
  media
  because she had worked for
  the fosmo family she had first
  moved to knivedby
  and she had joined the congregation
  because they were like oh we're so happy
  you're here blah blah blah
  and then they had for a very long time
  systematically abused her so at first
  she was like loved by
  all very welcomed hugged everyone was
  like oh my god
  you're saved blah blah blah you're gonna
  go to heaven
  and then helge fosmos told
  her that god talked through
  him and that god had told him
  that she needed to have sex with him
  so i'm just gonna say at this point that
  alarm bells alarm bells yes
  a sect is when people tell you
  you're not allowed to speak to people
  outside because
  they're not saved or they're not blah
  blah
  like it doesn't matter which kind of
  religion it's like if you can't speak to
  people
  outside of your own congregation
  that is alarm bell number one alarm bell
  number two
  is when people say that this d
  is gonna save you from hell
  if people are gonna say that they're
  gonna save you
  with their genitalia please call your
  family your insight
  unless it's me so
  it started out with them being like oh
  you're chosen by god
  to have sex with me and then it turned
  into
  this thing where ursa
  valdau which is the congregation's
  bride of christ which is a very extreme
  statement to make
  but people who are that manipulative
  and that full of themselves they search
  for
  a community where that can be
  used so Åsa Waldau
  psychologically broke her down
  because she told everyone that
  she was evil incarnated so it started
  out with
  helge fossmo trying to convince her that
  she was doing
  god's mission and then Åsa Waldau
  broke her down by convincing her
  that she had sinned so badly
  that she was not a person anymore this
  of course was during a couple of years
  obviously they started out being like
  super like
  attentive super like i see you
  you're a great person you can do god's
  mission in the world
  blah blah blah it started out really
  positive
  and then they broke her bit by bit by
  telling her that
  she wasn't she was so sinful
  that she didn't deserve to live
  and helge fossmo told her
  that he was battling demons
  for some weird inexplicable
  reason that he forced her to move into
  his bedroom
  for like eight months tending to him
  while he was battling demons
  for the bride of christ and after that
  she was so ostracized by the
  congregation
  and helge told her you are
  so sinful you are a slave
  and you're lucky that i am your master
  because i am a kind master
  and you will do this for god
  or you will forever be condemned
  and in Åsa Waldau's case she was
  dubbed the bride of christ because
  she was a pastor in another
  congregation like a youth pastor and
  then they said you can't work here
  anymore
  because your relationships to the young
  people are concerning because
  she started a sexual relationship
  with a man or a boy that was
  15 when she was 25
  and they couldn't prove that they just
  had like suspicions
  so they didn't tell the police because
  they were like well
  you seem a bit pedo so you can't work
  here anymore you're fired
  he took awesome valdau
  to his parents house which was in kenobi
  in the rules that they
  didn't have a relationship that she was
  just like a friend
  and then they married when he graduated
  from upper secondary school
  he was 18. is that upper secondary
  school
  just secondary school okay second
  sixth form but it's swedish so it's
  whatever you would call it
  we call it up secondary school
  lost him it's what we call it just
  sounded like you said gymnasium with a
  yeah then it is we call it gymnasium
  but that's weird none of our english
  listeners are going to be able to
  understand that
  okay he graduated from pe
  he was 18. he gets married to Åsa Waldau
  his parents hold on
  are we talking about helga patrick
  waldau so what's us okay because
  you haven't mentioned that name at all
  so far
  oh yeah i'm sorry
  she was fired as a pastor
  she had uncomfortable relationships
  with the youths
  youths i can't say that you
  just say teenage teenagers
  she had uncomfortable relationships with
  teenagers but they couldn't prove
  anything
  because none of the teenagers would say
  that she was
  being like it's less likely for a
  teenage boy to accuse
  an older woman of making advances than
  it would be the other way around
  yeah which is interesting because i
  still don't
  think he realizes that she was abusing
  him
  i don't think she was a position of
  power and
  he was yeah under her care
  he still thinks i think that they were
  in love
  that's obviously problematic
  after her being fired because of
  weird things about oceans
  yeah so he takes her home to
  knuthby where his parents
  are from and she becomes a pastor in
  that
  church in that church
  they become convinced
  that she is the bride of christ for some
  weird reason
  she performed a ritual where she was
  like devoting herself to
  christ and that's where the name bride
  of christ came from
  so it wasn't just like a random
  assignment there there was a whole
  candles and nighttime slaughtering of
  goats
  type thing involved well
  it wasn't really only about that it was
  like
  they had had prophecies in their quotes
  that a prosecuted woman
  would come to their congregation and she
  would be
  the bride of christ which i feel like is
  a bit like
  somebody got bored in their like
  their uh what is it called when they
  go to church to worship the whole thing
  insanity
  their service yeah that's a thing i
  think that i don't
  don't question me on acts of the church
  i'm the last person who's going to be
  able to answer any of these questions
  like somebody got bored a couple of
  years before
  and they were like yeah you know what
  bride of christ is gonna
  come to our church and she's gonna be
  prosecuted woman
  and she's gonna be amazed boss she's you
  know what they should have done
  what they should have given a call to
  the parish of dibley
  ask to borrow their vicar
  i actually understand that reference but
  damn
  somebody told them that the brightest
  of christ is going to come to our
  congregation and she's going to be the
  prologue
  for the returning of christ so she came
  to the congregation
  and they were like oh my god she was
  prosecuted by
  her other congregation and she is the
  bride of christ
  and she has a very manipulative
  sociopath
  was like of course i am i am
  god's intended wife which is
  crazy but she was
  extremely likable people were like oh my
  god she could see
  you she really connected to people
  she was really blah blah blah you know
  all of that shit
  so she formed a personal sect
  around her as the bride of christ
  she brought helge fossmo to that
  congregation
  because they had met a couple years
  earlier and she was like he is the voice
  of god
  he speaks from god to you
  and they were like okay
  but he was also a very very manipulative
  person and he came in being like yeah
  we're gonna all of us are going to
  heaven
  you all are chosen Åsa
  is the bride of christ this is like the
  reckoning
  history as we know it ends here
  he made them feel chosen
  and she made them feel chosen because
  of how extremely
  manipulative they were and
  then helga fossimo obviously got in
  trouble
  because he has a tendency to allegedly
  murder his wives he got incarcerated
  for the second attempt on his
  current wife which was orthos
  little sister so alexandra fossmo
  was osavaldo's little sister
  sora i feel really bad for her
  because she was so dehumanized
  for so long that she thought
  she was air quotes wrong
  and sinful in a way that she couldn't
  understand she was just trying to do the
  right thing
  and they treated her so
  badly for so long like they got
  the whole community to stop saying hello
  to her
  it was like she didn't exist
  where she lived she thought that god
  was speaking to her through anonymous
  text messages sent from helge
  that said that if you just do this for
  god
  mercy is gonna fall on you you sinful
  devil worshiper it was so crazy
  but she was obviously as i said
  sentenced
  to psychological help so she's out
  in the in society now
  which i think is not that bad
  because i feel like she was
  abused in a way that most people
  can't even imagine being abused
  like she was sexually assaulted she was
  dehumanized she was
  ostracized from a whole village
  for years before this happened
  when she had gotten the text messages
  about having to kill alexandra
  she tried to kill her with a hammer she
  got
  pushed out of the village they didn't
  call the police which is
  crazy but helge had told
  his other congregation members
  that he had dreams of alexandra
  dying he was like it's so horrible
  in my dreams alexandra is dead
  blah blah blah and people when she
  actually
  was killed people thought that he
  had premonitions prophesies
  premonitions yeah yeah so they thought
  that he was speaking from god which was
  also
  crazy but you know i mean that kind of
  sums up
  the problem with fanatical religious
  groups doesn't it
  yeah it does watching the documentary
  that
  mission investigate had done
  it's so clear that usavaldo
  has so much internalized misogyny
  that she treated women in her
  congregation
  like shit she had these
  chosen women in the group
  that were like yeah you have been chosen
  by god to be my servers
  so they spent all of their money
  that they earned from their jobs on her
  they would wait on her all the time they
  would give her massages they would cook
  her food
  they would buy her clothes they would do
  everything for her it's also a
  stipulation
  that any member of this cult had to give
  10 of their earnings towards the cult
  and also that i think that she convinced
  the others so much that she was chosen
  by god
  that they didn't see it happening in the
  beginning
  it was like all hugs and like joy
  and warmth and meaning
  she would provide meaning in life
  for her subjugates or like
  servers or like stuff and then the more
  the years went on the worse she would
  treat them
  so she would say that somebody's wrong
  you need to take their children away
  from that person
  which they did she would say that
  you've done this right for so long and
  she'd been like
  praising them and then suddenly she
  would get
  violent hit them and
  jump on them and she would like
  tell them that they had to move into a
  shed in her garden where they weren't
  allowed to sleep on mattresses
  she would bind them she would treat
  other women so incredibly badly
  that i feel like this is crazy that all
  this went
  on without the swedish government being
  involved
  in any way because in 2004
  alexandra is murdered helge is put in
  prison
  or Åsa Waldau is still in the congregation
  in 2020 the trial begins
  against osa valdau urban
  one of her ministers or pastors
  in the congregation that had sexually
  assaulted a 17 year old
  and also forced a lot of the other women
  to have
  sexual relationships with him because
  he said that it was a fight against the
  demons
  to get jesus there for all Åsa Waldau
  to marry and looking on it from the
  outside
  i understand that this is so fucking
  crazy
  but it was apologies if you picked up
  any bad language listeners
  it was so crazy because of the fact that
  sweden is such a secular state
  but nobody took care to
  investigate the children and the
  teenagers in the cult
  nobody made sure that they were all
  right
  because they went to school because
  homeschooling isn't allowed
  in sweden which is good but
  they went to school in knutby where some
  of their
  teachers was a part of the cult
  so they were like brainwashed from day
  one
  some of them tried to kill themselves
  and then they were further ostracized
  in the congregation for trying to kill
  themselves
  because that would make them be in hell
  it's the ultimate sin so like for them
  there was no escape the girl who
  was sexually abused when she was 17
  urban started making sexual
  advances towards her when she was 14
  years old
  and the urban is like maybe 20 years
  her senior he was another
  minister or pastor that she brought into
  the congregation
  who would abuse power like he
  probably looked for a situation where
  they would treat him as a god because
  they did
  they were like well he is speaking
  directly from god
  which also said that he was and
  he had sexual relationships with
  a lot of the women in the congregation
  because he said that his
  dick would be their salvation which
  again alarm bells if someone says
  that you need to have sex with them to
  be saved
  it's a fucking cult well
  this girl she went to awesome
  told her about the sexual abuse
  from urban orsa made her lay down on her
  stomach
  and then jumped on her four times
  with her parents in the room and i feel
  like
  alsa should be locked up
  forever i don't want Åsa in our society
  i don't want urban in our fucking
  society
  both of them are still out in our
  society
  well not an hour in my well in sweden
  it's crazy and that's why no one lives
  in sweden
  [Laughter]
  well we have a very low population but
  i feel like what i couldn't understand
  about this whole case
  is one why helge
  didn't get prosecuted for the murder
  of his first wife can you tell me a bit
  about that
  [Music]
  i feel like the first hour of this
  podcast has been about
  cults and now we're on the murders
  well it's 30 minutes but
  [Laughter]
  so how'd you say her name
  the first wife yeah helian or helen
  if you want to say helen hillian
  yeah so helen
  [Laughter]
  now you know my struggle in every
  episode oh i want you to try and
  pronounce the opiate that was found in
  our system that would be fun
  look see blah blah blah blah blah blah
  yeah that one wait wait let me do it
  sex proposition
  sure let's go with that how would you
  say it
  uh dextropropoxyphene okay
  that does sound more accurate
  that sounds like it could be a thing
  so she was found like
  aforementioned with a hole
  in her skull and a toxic concentration
  of dextropropoxyphene in her blood
  system
  originally the case was dropped
  because the hole in her skull
  wasn't able to be linked to anything
  and so it was difficult to relate that
  back to whether that was caused by
  her falling over in the bath whether
  that could have been
  a blunt instrument the thing
  about the dextro is that there was none
  found in her stomach
  which is probably the most interesting
  part
  about the autopsy report in that you'd
  expect
  anything ingested orally
  to still be present in the stomach upon
  autopsy after death but there was
  nothing in her stomach
  um so there was one prosecutor
  or coroner i can't remember what his
  position was
  that said the most likely route of
  administration
  would have been either iv so injected
  straight into the bloodstream
  or either administered vaginally
  or anally again
  um if it was administered vaginally or
  anally you'd expect to find
  some in those cavities i don't know
  whether they did or not
  i couldn't they might have checked yeah
  i can't find the autopsy reports
  anywhere all of the media coverage just
  says that she was found with the toxic
  substance
  it's interesting to note that
  dextropropoxyphene
  was readily available at the time of the
  crime
  as a prescription drug but has been
  withdrawn from almost all
  markets it's been withdrawn from the us
  it's been withdrawn from the eu uk
  sweden particularly because
  of the problems raised about its
  efficacy
  versus its toxicity so
  all of the drugs when they're put on the
  market
  are given a therapeutic index
  and a therapeutic index is basically the
  difference between
  how much you need to take to get the
  therapeutic dose
  which is whatever you're taking it for
  in this case it would be pain relief
  and the toxic dose now most drugs have
  quite a wide therapeutic window which is
  obviously ideal you don't want your
  toxic dose to be too close to your
  therapeutic dose
  but dextro has an incredibly narrow
  therapeutic index which caused a lot of
  questions
  about 20 years after it was
  widely available on the market which is
  what's caused its withdrawal
  it also becomes particularly toxic when
  it's combined with alcohol
  usually because of the higher doses that
  are required
  so because it's a weak opioid
  you need to take a lot more of it to be
  able to get that therapeutic dose
  than you would cocodimole
  morphine all of the other opiates that
  are available
  so if she were to have taken it
  with alcohol you would expect
  that that toxic dose would have dropped
  significantly whereas the therapeutic
  dose would have stayed the same
  so you're narrowing that window even
  further
  a lot of opiates can cause
  central nervous system depression
  respiratory depression
  and cardiac depression and depression in
  this case
  is just the that system
  being less responsive so cns depression
  is your central nervous system stops
  being responsive
  so you're less receptive to pain you're
  less receptive to
  external stimulus which is usually what
  painkillers are taken for but
  respiratory depression
  and cardiac depression are particular
  problems
  when you're taking medication in the
  they then make it harder to breathe and
  they make your heart
  work harder to provide the same amount
  of
  oxygenated blood that it would normally
  so it's perfectly possible that in the
  dose that she had taken
  she had experienced the respiratory
  depression
  and the cardiac depression to cause
  death
  particularly if it were mixed with
  alcohol and when she was found
  um it was in the bath but there was no
  water
  found in her lungs which basically rules
  out drowning
  so you can be pretty much sure that
  her cause of death was the
  administration of the drugs
  and that she was dead before she was in
  the bathtub
  and not even like unconscious before she
  was in the bathtub because if she was
  unconscious she would have still been
  breathing
  and then you would expect to find water
  in her lungs and i think she was found
  the next day i think there was water in
  the bathtub because i think
  the first response kind of thought that
  it was drowning
  yeah which would be normal you hit your
  head on the faucet
  you fall into the bathtub you're
  unconscious
  you aspirate the water you drown
  but given that when there was no water
  found in the lungs you can rule that out
  which means
  that it's perfectly possible that her
  head injury
  was caused by falling on the faucet
  which would be why there was no
  correlation between
  blunt weapon trauma and
  the wound that she had on her head it
  couldn't have been caused by a hammer
  because it was caused by the faucet
  was that ruled out that it couldn't be
  blunt force trauma well it would have
  been blunt force trauma but blunt force
  trauma wasn't the cause of death
  okay so the drugs was definitely a cause
  of
  the yeah the drugs were the cause of
  death but the most interesting point was
  that there was none
  found in her stomach so we don't know
  how it was administered
  whether it be iv whether it be
  crushed up tablets administered through
  any other orifice
  but we're basically ruling out the
  ingestion
  of the drugs which pretty much rules out
  suicide i don't think there's been any
  cases
  that i know of having studied forensic
  science where someone's decided
  to commit suicide via od
  and has administered any other way than
  oral or iv okay which
  kind of leads towards the fact that it
  was
  murder but again without knowing
  the root of the administration 100
  there's not enough scientific evidence
  to be able to say that
  this was the route and therefore this is
  the chain of events so it kind of was
  that
  helga allegedly didn't have a
  congregation of minions to do the murder
  for him
  so he kind of had to take things into
  his own hands
  yeah or obviously not had to but he
  wasn't fucking
  psychopath so he is still
  incarcerated and i think he was up for
  a parole in 2020
  which i think might not have happened it
  got
  turned down by the court of appeal yeah
  yeah so he was
  initially eligible for parole this year
  but they blocked that request oh
  thank god because sweden is good in very
  many ways
  like they don't have the death penalty
  blah blah blah
  but they're also very a lot of
  horrible crimes gets very
  short sentences but helge go
  i think 25 24
  so that's obviously maybe not enough
  but it's something because in 2020 the
  trials began
  for three other pastors
  of the sect the canopy sect
  and peter he accused himself
  of waldow and urban
  the other weirdo
  and for him he accused himself of
  abuse like physical abuse and
  something else i mean if you're doing it
  yourself it's more of a confession
  yeah well he confessed to the crimes but
  i think he also brought charges
  against yeah so that would be an
  accusation but against himself would be
  a confession
  okay they were all sentenced but they
  got
  like nothing they got like no jail
  sentence
  they had to pay uh fine and they got
  like
  what is it called when you're sentenced
  but you get to be
  home but you also need to do community
  service i guess community service
  yeah but i also feel like
  they got off too mildly
  they shouldn't be out at all it's so
  crazy
  absolute bonkers
  [Laughter]
  do you have any do you have anything
  else to say about
  the case no no
  i'm dead actually found this one the
  least interesting
  did you i thought it's so interesting
  but that's probably because it's about a
  sect and i'm like oh my god
  my job is to bring in the forensics role
  and this case was cut and dry
  she admitted to it no questions asked
  helge fosmo i've heard that he has like
  a blog
  and stuff from prison he got married
  from prison and he need
  a lot of like internet presence
  i would just like to say to you you're a
  cunt

The Bride of Christ, or Åsa Waldau, is at the epicentre of the Knutby Murder, the murder of Alexandra Fossmo commited by a brainwashed cult member and orchestrated by a pastor (Alexandras husband) in a congregation situated in a village in Sweden. Sandra tries to teach Joe how to pronounce Swedish words, and Joe is trying not to get sued for defamation. Sandra got her information from Uppdrag Gransknings (Mission: investigate) docu series called "Knutby" as well as wikipedia, Joe got his information from wikipedia (and allegedly, his brain). The picture of Saint Catherine being symbolically married to baby Jesus is painted by Paolo Veronese and can be found on [wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paolo_Veronese_013.jpg).



#### Audio transcript 



Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content,
listener discretion is advised.
\[Laughter] You're listening to Midweek Murders and
that means that it's time to talk about
crime.
This is Joe. Hello! And this is Sandra.
Hi.
That was fucking awkward.
It's better to say "I'm Sandra, and this
is: Hello I'm Joe". It's not,
because you're basically introducing it
as "let's talk about crime, I'm sandra,
and this is...
Joe" like how how do I come into that? I
can't be
upbeat and preppy and like "Hey listeners!
I'm Joe".
It's just like, and this is Joe.
Obviously as it has been for the past
four weeks, like
the fuck do you expect it to be? Frank?
Oh it's true. \[humming jingle].
This week's introduction is jazz.
\[Music]

This week we're going to talk about the
Knutby murder, which was a
very scandalous moment
for the swedish national news,
I guess. I was quite young when it
happened,
and I remember... Sandra, you were born 75.
Well metaphorically yes, but
at that time I think I was 14.
Does that make sense? Yeah it does, I was 14.
And I remember it being on the news and
I was like:
"What in the hell?" because
Sweden is one of the most secular
countries in the world, and for
us to have like... Okay, let's start from
the beginning,
sorry. Always a good place to
start.
I got my information from mission
investigate, or Uppdrag Granskning,
they had a docu-series about the
case which came out quite recently.
And also wikipedia, wikiwiki waaah.
I also got my.... What the fuck is it?
Information.
I thought you were gonna say a swedish
word so I was prepared to help you.
Yeah, I got my information from wikipedia,
and also my brain.


So in the 10th
of january 2004,
Alexandra Fossmo was shot,
but they didn't know that at first
because the one that
called the police was the neighbor who
was shot two times
but survived. And his name was Daniel. Now
I can't say it in swedish
or english.
Sorry, I completely poo pooed your
lovely pronunciation there. Okay, Daniel
Linde.
And for the english listeners we're just
gonna call him Daniel.
Daniel, yeah, but first...
Nobody knew what... The trouble
I've seen
\[Music] my sorrow....
\[Music] \[Laughter] So Daniel calls the police, and
the police arrest Sara Svensson
at her childhood home in... not where they were shot, like in
a more southern part of
Sweden. Sorry, sorry,
excuse me. And quite early on
they understand that Sara thinks that she
is on a mission to save her soul.
And they were like, oh oh this smells
like
indoctrination, or brainwashing or
whatever you want to call it. They kind
of keyed into the fact
that she sounded not of sound mind
when they arrested her. 

So
during the prosecution
of Sara they understand
that she has been getting these
anonymous messages on her phone,
from what she thinks is
God, or somebody working for God.
And that obviously sounded
crazy. All of the messages that she
said that she had gotten were deleted.
But with the technology that they had at
the time
they managed to get those
messages from her phone. So she had
turned
her phone in, and she had said that she had
done
the murder of Alexandra Fossmo, and also
the attempted murder of Daniel. But
from the text messages that they were
able to
retrieve, even though they were deleted,
there was hundreds of messages
saying that "what you need to do
for God is murder Alexandra,
and then murder Daniel".
So this was very confusing at the time,
I remember when it came on the
news and everything and I
and everyone in Sweden was like "what in
the hell".
But it unearthed...
What do you call it, like it came to
light this whole
fucked up situation? Unearthed is fine.
Revealed?
Yeah, it revealed, it uncovered
this very weird sect in
Knutby, which is very close to Stockholm,
and a part of the county where a lot of
people go to study.
And what it revealed about that
sect, which they wouldn't call themselves
at the time,
in that community they quickly unearthed
that one of the key players in
that church was a woman called
Åsa Waldau, who
said that she was the bride of christ.
And the people engaged in that
church also called her the bride of
christ,
or the queen of heaven. Oh,
that's what it meant.
Which is very very problematic
in a very general kind of sense, but
in this particular congregation
it was extremely problematic
which wouldn't come out until later.
But Sara was prosecuted by the
state and also they
tracked those text messages that she had
gotten,
from air quotes God, to
her minister or pastor
Helge Fossmo, or Fossmo.
No, I said in English twice! Fuck it.


He, in himself, turned out to be extremely
problematic,
because he had murdered
his first wife on the 18th december of
1999...
Reportedly. Yeah well, allegedly.
But I think he did do that. Yeah, but you
can't
for legal reasons say that he did it if
he hasn't been prosecuted for it.
Well, they did kind of like
throw it out there, the prosecution, that
he
might have killed his first wife as well.
Yeah, but just trust me you can't legally
say
that he has killed his first wife, you
have to put in
allegedly. Yeah, no, I do trust you.
I just feel like i don't care because
nobody listens except for the bots.
Look, if we have to cite our sources
then you can't accuse people of murder.
Okay fine, he was accused
of his first wife's murder
Helen, Helen, sorry.
Just say them in Swedish, it's fine.
The more you say them in Swedish the
more I'm going to be able to replicate
the sounds.
Okay, Helen. Because in 1999
she was found dead in her bathtub
with a toxic concentration of
an opioid found in prescription
painkillers,
that had been prescribed for
Helge Fossmo. And she also had
a wound, or a hole, in her temple
that at the time they thought that she
had
banged her head on the faucet
of the bathtub.
I can hear you pouring beer. I was gonna
mute myself
but then I thought you might need my
input. Turns out
I was just spending the whole time
sassing you.
Yeah. You're wrong. They did
bring it up as the prosecution point and
he was found
not guilty. Yes, so he wasn't prosecuted
for it.
I'm gonna say you're misunderstanding me,
but I... I'm understanding you, but the
legal term of
prosecution is to win your case against
x y and z. So if the charges were dropped
because there was insufficient evidence
or whatever,
then he hasn't been prosecuted for it. Oh,
okay, I thought it was like... Because
at the time when she actually was
allegedly
murdered in 1999, they
just ruled it out as a accident.
Accidental death, yeah, then they reopened
it as
a possible attempted murder or murder.
But there isn't sufficient evidence to
charge him for it,
so that was all dropped and his prison
time
was for Alexandra.
Exactly.
But what is it called then, like when
it's,
when it's like charging?
Yeah, it's a charge for that
crime, well, alleged crime.


He was he was sentenced,
obviously, for conspiring
to murder his second wife and
his next-door neighbor. Which,
digging more into it, his neighbor
was a husband to a woman that he was
having
an affair with. And Sara
was on trial and did
a full confession and told them all
about
how she got the gun, and she was
sentenced
to institutional psychiatric care.
And that makes sense to me because
after actually digging into this case,
which I did from a very early age,
which is obviously concerning.
But I was very interested in what
happened. It turns out that Sara,
she was called the nanny in Swedish
media
because she had worked for
the Fossmo family, she had first
moved to Knutby
and she had joined the congregation
because they were like "oh we're so happy
you're here blah blah blah".
And then they had for a very long time
systematically abused her. So at first
she was like loved by
all, very welcomed, hugged, everyone was
like "oh my god
you're saved blah blah blah, you're gonna
go to heaven".
And then Helge Fossmos told
her that God talked through
him, and that God had told him
that she needed to have sex with him.
So I'm just gonna say at this point that...
Alarm bells. Alarm bells, yes.
A sect is when people tell you
you're not allowed to speak to people
outside because
they're not saved, or they're not blah
blah.
Like it doesn't matter which kind of
religion it's like if you can't speak to
people
outside of your own congregation
that is alarm bell number one. Alarm bell
number two
is when people say that this D
is gonna save you from hell.
If people are gonna say that they're
gonna save you
with their genitalia please call your
family, you're in a sect.
Unless it's me. So
it started out with them being like "oh
you're chosen by God
to have sex with me" and then it turned
into
this thing where Asa
Waldau, which is the congregation's
bride of christ, which is a very extreme
statement to make.
But people who are that manipulative
and that full of themselves, they search
for
a community where that can be
used. So Åsa Waldau
psychologically broke her down
because she told everyone that
she was evil incarnated. So it started
out with
Helge Fossmo trying to convince her that
she was doing
God's mission, and then Åsa Waldau
broke her down by convincing her
that she had sinned so badly
that she was not a person anymore. This,
of course, was during a couple of years.
Obviously they started out being like
super like
attentive, super like "I see you,
you're a great person, you can do god's
mission in the world
blah blah blah". It started out really
positive,
and then they broke her bit by bit, by
telling her that
she wasn't, that she was so sinful
that she didn't deserve to live.
And Helge Fossmo told her
that he was battling demons
for some weird inexplicable
reason, then he forced her to move into
his bedroom
for like eight months tending to him
while he was battling demons
for the bride of christ, and after that
she was so ostracized by the
congregation.
And helge told her "you are
so sinful you are a slave,
and you're lucky that I am your master,
because I am a kind master.
And you will do this for God
or you will forever be condemned".


And in Åsa Waldau's case she was
dubbed the bride of christ because
she was a pastor in another
congregation, like a youth pastor and
then they said you can't work here
anymore
because your relationships to the young
people are concerning. Because
she started a sexual relationship
with a man or a boy that was
15 when she was 25.
And they couldn't prove that, they just
had like suspicions,
so they didn't tell the police because
they were like "well
you seem a bit pedo, so you can't work
here anymore, you're fired".


He took Asa Waldau
to his parents house which was in Knutby,
in the ruse that they
didn't have a relationship, that she was
just a friend.
And then they married when he graduated
from upper secondary school.
He was 18, is that upper secondary
school?
Just secondary school. Okay, second...
Sixth form, but it's Swedish so it's
whatever you would call it.
We call it gymnasium, it's what we call. It just
sounded like you said gymnasium with a.
Yeah it is, we call it gymnasium.
But that's weird, none of our english
listeners are going to be able to
understand that.
Okay, he graduated from PE.
He was 18. He gets married to Åsa Waldau
his parents... Hold on,
are we talking about Helge? Patrick
Waldau. Okay, because
you haven't mentioned that name at all
so far.
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
She was fired as a pastor because
she had uncomfortable relationships
with the youths.
Youths. I can't say that. Just say teenagers. Teenagers.
She had uncomfortable relationships with
teenagers, but they couldn't prove
anything
because none of the teenagers would say
that she was
being like... It's less likely for a
teenage boy to accuse
an older woman of making advances than
it would be the other way around.
Yeah, which is interesting because I
still don't
think he realizes that she was abusing
him,
I don't think. She was a position of
power and
he was, yeah, under her care.
He still thinks, I think, that they were
in love.
That's obviously problematic
after her being fired because of
weird things about oceans.
Yeah, so he takes her home to
Knutby, where his parents
are from, and she becomes a pastor in
that
church. In that church
they become convinced
that she is the bride of christ for some
weird reason...
She performed a ritual where she was
like devoting herself to
christ, and that's where the name bride
of christ came from.
So it wasn't just like a random
assignment, there there was a whole
candles and nighttime slaughtering of
goats
type thing involved. Well,
it wasn't really only about that, it was
like
they had had prophecies in air quotes,
that a prosecuted woman
would come to their congregation and she
would be
the bride of christ. Which I feel like, is
a bit like
somebody got bored in their like
their... What is it called when they
go to church to worship, the whole thing?
Insanity.
Their service. Yeah that's a thing, I
think. Don't question me on acts of the church,
I'm the last person who's going to be
able to answer any of these questions.
Somebody got bored a couple of
years before,
and they were like "yeah, you know what?
Bride of christ is gonna
come to our church and she's gonna be
prosecuted woman,
and she's gonna be amazeboobs, she's"... You
know what they should have done?
What? They should have given a call to
the parish of dibley,
ask to borrow their vicar.
I actually understand that reference. Ba 
bam.
Somebody told them that the bride
of christ is going to come to our
congregation and she's going to be the
prologue
for the returning of christ. So she came
to the congregation
and they were like "oh my god she was
prosecuted by
her other congregation and she is the
bride of christ".
And she, as a very manipulative
sociopath
was like "of course I am, I am
god's intended wife". Which is
crazy, but she was
extremely likable, people were like "oh my
god, she could see
you, she really connected to people,
she was really blah blah blah", you know,
all of that shit.
So she formed a personal sect
around her as the bride of christ.
She brought Helge Fossmo to that
congregation,
because they had met a couple years
earlier, and she was like "he is the voice
of god,
he speaks from god to you".
And they were like, okay.


But he was also a very, very manipulative
person, and he came in being like "yeah
we're gonna... all of us are going to
heaven,
you all are chosen, Åsa
is the bride of christ, this is like the
reckoning,
history as we know it ends here".
He made them feel chosen,
and she made them feel chosen because
of how extremely
manipulative they were. And
then Helge Fossmo obviously got in
trouble
because he has a tendency to allegedly
murder his wives. He got incarcerated
for the second attempt on his
current wife which was Asas
little sister. So Alexandra Fossmo
was Asa Waldau's little sister.


Sara, I feel really bad for her
because she was so dehumanized
for so long that she thought
she was air quotes wrong
and sinful in a way that she couldn't
understand. She was just trying to do the
right thing,
and they treated her so
badly for so long, like they got
the whole community to stop saying hello
to her.
It was like she didn't exist
where she lived. She thought that God
was speaking to her through anonymous
text messages sent from Helge
that said that "if you just do this for
God,
mercy is gonna fall on you you sinful
devil worshiper". It was so crazy.
But she was obviously, as I said,
sentenced
to psychological help, so she's out
in society now.
Which, I think, is not that bad.
Because I feel like she was
abused in a way that most people
can't even imagine being abused.
She was sexually assaulted, she was
dehumanized, she was
ostracized from a whole village
for years before this happened.
When she had gotten the text messages
about having to kill Alexandra
she tried to kill her with a hammer, she
got
pushed out of the village. They didn't
call the police, which is
crazy. But Helge had told
his other congregation members
that he had dreams of Alexandra
dying, he was like "it's so horrible,
in my dreams Alexandra is dead
blah blah blah", and people... When she
actually
was killed, people thought that he
had premonitions. Prophesies?
Premonitions, yeah. Yeah, so they thought
that he was speaking from God which was
also
crazy, but you know... I mean that kind of
sums up
the problem with fanatical religious
groups doesn't it?
Yeah it does. 

Watching the documentary
that
mission investigate had done,
it's so clear that Asa Waldau
has so much internalized misogyny
that she treated women in her
congregation
like shit. She had these
chosen women in the group
that were like yeah you have been chosen
by god to be my servers
so they spent all of their money
that they earned from their jobs on her
they would wait on her all the time they
would give her massages they would cook
her food
they would buy her clothes they would do
everything for her it's also a
stipulation
that any member of this cult had to give
10 of their earnings towards the cult
and also that i think that she convinced
the others so much that she was chosen
by god
that they didn't see it happening in the
beginning
it was like all hugs and like joy
and warmth and meaning
she would provide meaning in life
for her subjugates or like
servers or like stuff and then the more
the years went on the worse she would
treat them
so she would say that somebody's wrong
you need to take their children away
from that person
which they did she would say that
you've done this right for so long and
she'd been like
praising them and then suddenly she
would get
violent hit them and
jump on them and she would like
tell them that they had to move into a
shed in her garden where they weren't
allowed to sleep on mattresses
she would bind them she would treat
other women so incredibly badly
that i feel like this is crazy that all
this went
on without the swedish government being
involved
in any way. Because in 2004
Alexandra is murdered, Helge is put in
prison.

Åsa Waldau is still in the congregation
in 2020 the trial begins
against Asa Waldau, Urban
one of her ministers or pastors
in the congregation, that had sexually
assaulted a 17 year old
and also forced a lot of the other women
to have
sexual relationships with him. Because
he said that it was a fight against the
demons
to get jesus there for all Åsa Waldau
to marry and looking on it from the
outside
i understand that this is so fucking
crazy
but it was apologies if you picked up
any bad language listeners
it was so crazy because of the fact that
sweden is such a secular state
but nobody took care to
investigate the children and the
teenagers in the cult
nobody made sure that they were all
right
because they went to school because
homeschooling isn't allowed
in sweden which is good but
they went to school in knutby where some
of their
teachers was a part of the cult
so they were like brainwashed from day
one
some of them tried to kill themselves
and then they were further ostracized
in the congregation for trying to kill
themselves
because that would make them be in hell
it's the ultimate sin so like for them
there was no escape the girl who
was sexually abused when she was 17
urban started making sexual
advances towards her when she was 14
years old
and the urban is like maybe 20 years
her senior he was another
minister or pastor that she brought into
the congregation
who would abuse power like he
probably looked for a situation where
they would treat him as a god because
they did
they were like well he is speaking
directly from god
which also said that he was and
he had sexual relationships with
a lot of the women in the congregation
because he said that his
dick would be their salvation which
again alarm bells if someone says
that you need to have sex with them to
be saved
it's a fucking cult well
this girl she went to awesome
told her about the sexual abuse
from urban orsa made her lay down on her
stomach
and then jumped on her four times
with her parents in the room and i feel
like
alsa should be locked up
forever i don't want Åsa in our society,
I don't want Urban in our fucking
society.
Both of them are still out in our
society.
Well, not in our, in my... Well, in Sweden.
It's crazy. And that's why no one lives
in Sweden.
\[Laughter] well we have a very low population. 

But
i feel like what i couldn't understand
about this whole case
is one why helge
didn't get prosecuted for the murder
of his first wife can you tell me a bit
about that
\[Music] i feel like the first hour of this
podcast has been about
cults and now we're on the murders
well it's 30 minutes but
\[Laughter] so how'd you say her name
the first wife yeah helian or helen
if you want to say helen hillian
yeah so helen
\[Laughter] now you know my struggle in every
episode oh i want you to try and
pronounce the opiate that was found in
our system that would be fun
look see blah blah blah blah blah blah
yeah that one wait wait let me do it
sex proposition
sure let's go with that how would you
say it
uh dextropropoxyphene okay
that does sound more accurate
that sounds like it could be a thing
so she was found like
aforementioned with a hole
in her skull and a toxic concentration
of dextropropoxyphene in her blood
system
originally the case was dropped
because the hole in her skull
wasn't able to be linked to anything
and so it was difficult to relate that
back to whether that was caused by
her falling over in the bath whether
that could have been
a blunt instrument the thing
about the dextro is that there was none
found in her stomach
which is probably the most interesting
part
about the autopsy report in that you'd
expect
anything ingested orally
to still be present in the stomach upon
autopsy after death but there was
nothing in her stomach
um so there was one prosecutor
or coroner i can't remember what his
position was
that said the most likely route of
administration
would have been either iv so injected
straight into the bloodstream
or either administered vaginally
or anally again
um if it was administered vaginally or
anally you'd expect to find
some in those cavities i don't know
whether they did or not
i couldn't they might have checked yeah
i can't find the autopsy reports
anywhere all of the media coverage just
says that she was found with the toxic
substance
it's interesting to note that
dextropropoxyphene
was readily available at the time of the
crime
as a prescription drug but has been
withdrawn from almost all
markets it's been withdrawn from the us
it's been withdrawn from the eu uk
sweden particularly because
of the problems raised about its
efficacy
versus its toxicity so
all of the drugs when they're put on the
market
are given a therapeutic index
and a therapeutic index is basically the
difference between
how much you need to take to get the
therapeutic dose
which is whatever you're taking it for
in this case it would be pain relief
and the toxic dose now most drugs have
quite a wide therapeutic window which is
obviously ideal you don't want your
toxic dose to be too close to your
therapeutic dose
but dextro has an incredibly narrow
therapeutic index which caused a lot of
questions
about 20 years after it was
widely available on the market which is
what's caused its withdrawal
it also becomes particularly toxic when
it's combined with alcohol
usually because of the higher doses that
are required
so because it's a weak opioid
you need to take a lot more of it to be
able to get that therapeutic dose
than you would cocodimole
morphine all of the other opiates that
are available
so if she were to have taken it
with alcohol you would expect
that that toxic dose would have dropped
significantly whereas the therapeutic
dose would have stayed the same
so you're narrowing that window even
further
a lot of opiates can cause
central nervous system depression
respiratory depression
and cardiac depression and depression in
this case
is just the that system
being less responsive so cns depression
is your central nervous system stops
being responsive
so you're less receptive to pain you're
less receptive to
external stimulus which is usually what
painkillers are taken for but
respiratory depression
and cardiac depression are particular
problems
when you're taking medication in the
they then make it harder to breathe and
they make your heart
work harder to provide the same amount
of
oxygenated blood that it would normally
so it's perfectly possible that in the
dose that she had taken
she had experienced the respiratory
depression
and the cardiac depression to cause
death
particularly if it were mixed with
alcohol and when she was found
um it was in the bath but there was no
water
found in her lungs which basically rules
out drowning
so you can be pretty much sure that
her cause of death was the
administration of the drugs
and that she was dead before she was in
the bathtub
and not even like unconscious before she
was in the bathtub because if she was
unconscious she would have still been
breathing
and then you would expect to find water
in her lungs and i think she was found
the next day i think there was water in
the bathtub because i think
the first response kind of thought that
it was drowning
yeah which would be normal you hit your
head on the faucet
you fall into the bathtub you're
unconscious
you aspirate the water you drown
but given that when there was no water
found in the lungs you can rule that out
which means
that it's perfectly possible that her
head injury
was caused by falling on the faucet
which would be why there was no
correlation between
blunt weapon trauma and
the wound that she had on her head it
couldn't have been caused by a hammer
because it was caused by the faucet
was that ruled out that it couldn't be
blunt force trauma well it would have
been blunt force trauma but blunt force
trauma wasn't the cause of death
okay so the drugs was definitely a cause
of
the yeah the drugs were the cause of
death but the most interesting point was
that there was none
found in her stomach so we don't know
how it was administered
whether it be iv whether it be
crushed up tablets administered through
any other orifice
but we're basically ruling out the
ingestion
of the drugs which pretty much rules out
suicide i don't think there's been any
cases
that i know of having studied forensic
science where someone's decided
to commit suicide via od
and has administered any other way than
oral or iv okay which
kind of leads towards the fact that it
was
murder but again without knowing
the root of the administration 100
there's not enough scientific evidence
to be able to say that
this was the route and therefore this is
the chain of events so it kind of was
that
Helge allegedly didn't have a
congregation of minions to do the murder
for him
so he kind of had to take things into
his own hands.
Yeah, or obviously not had to, but he
was a fucking
psychopath.

So he is still
incarcerated and i think he was up for
a parole in 2020
which i think might not have happened it
got
turned down by the court of appeal yeah
yeah so he was
initially eligible for parole this year
but they blocked that request oh
thank god because sweden is good in very
many ways
like they don't have the death penalty
blah blah blah
but they're also very a lot of
horrible crimes gets very
short sentences but helge go
i think 25 24
so that's obviously maybe not enough
but it's something because in 2020 the
trials began
for three other pastors
of the sect the canopy sect
and peter he accused himself
of Waldau and Urban,
the other weirdo,
and for him he accused himself of
abuse like physical abuse and
something else i mean if you're doing it
yourself it's more of a confession
yeah well he confessed to the crimes but
i think he also brought charges
against yeah so that would be an
accusation but against himself would be
a confession
okay they were all sentenced but they
got
like nothing they got like no jail
sentence
they had to pay uh fine and they got
like
what is it called when you're sentenced
but you get to be
home but you also need to do community
service i guess community service
yeah but i also feel like
they got off too mildly
they shouldn't be out at all. It's so
crazy.
Absolute bonkers.
\[Laughter] 



Do you have any do you have anything
else to say about
the case no no
i'm dead actually found this one the
least interesting
did you i thought it's so interesting
but that's probably because it's about a
sect and i'm like oh my god
my job is to bring in the forensics role
and this case was cut and dry
she admitted to it no questions asked
helge fosmo i've heard that he has like
a blog
and stuff from prison he got married
from prison and he need
a lot of like internet presence
i would just like to say to you you're a
cunt
you're a horrible man and
you should stay in prison for all time
and please stop being on the internet
because
it just stop redownloading our videos
it's skewing our numbers
we don't have videos i meant audio
do you want to try the swedish
pronunciations again
pronunciations urban
like ebay creations
please you could do it you could do it i
believe in you
not until you say the word right again
pronunciation pronunciations
there we go away
okay urban liking
urban yeah that's not like uber
at all hellion like
helen but hillian
yeah that's really good wow
wow that was patronizing.jpg
