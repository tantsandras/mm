  midweek murders contains graphic and
  explicit content
  listener discretion is advised
  you know a funny thing that happened you
  gave
  birth to a live turtle that would have
  been funnier
  but alas would have been funny because
  turtles
  are born from eggs
  well you don't know how i lived my life
  i might have been impregnated by a bird
  then it still would have been born
  through an egg dummy
  that's the joke
  i got home and the buddha had
  kicked out poop from her litter box
  into the hallway i was like i'm just
  disgusted
  and impressed that is
  not too shabby that's a fair distance
  kicking better than the
  watford football team okay fuck you
  hashtag too soon too soon
  [Music]
  the worst part of this is that
  i'm gonna ask her for your birthday but
  you would rather i forget the worst part
  of that is you don't remember when my
  birthday is
  i don't remember when your birthday is i
  thought that you would be
  thrilled
  i mean if there was one person
  i would expect to remember when my
  birthday is
  it would be my best fucking friend
  you sound like my mom i can't even
  remember my
  own birthday okay no
  that's not okay is it the fourth not
  even fucking close to me
  [Laughter]
  i believe you oh it's hilarious
  how long have we known each other now
  i don't know that either man but you
  don't celebrate our fucking friend
  diversary
  i don't use facebook
  do you know how long we've been friends
  i know when your fucking birthday is
  though
  [Laughter]
  when is it the 9th of march well that
  just
  shut me up didn't it yeah suck a dick
  bitch
  [Laughter]
  i mean you're right i don't want any
  undue attention
  or focus brought to it but you know you
  could at least still
  fucking remember
  adorable you could you could at least
  remember the day
  that you're meant to forget
  [Laughter]
  i'm sorry i know it's in september
  somewhere
  it's very very easy to remember
  it's the day after 9 11.
  so is it the 10th oh good lord
  just go back over what i said
  in your head and then go back over
  what you said and realize
  why that is so incredibly wrong
  i don't know what you're saying you're
  talking and dolphin pitch
  oh god i can't breathe i almost peed
  myself
  i realized it's the 12th
  [Laughter]
  which which kind of speaks to the
  whole i can't remember any kind of
  date or month thing that i didn't
  realize
  that 9 11 wasn't it was the other way
  around
  it wasn't the 9th of november
  because in sweden we ride it the other
  way around
  yeah like like the rest of the world
  yeah that was
  hilarious but also painful
  [Laughter]
  also i know what day of the week i was
  born on
  just fun fact for you because the day
  after was friday the 13th
  oh yeah you say oh yeah like you knew
  that the 12th of september in 1991 was a
  thursday
  no i just meant that it kind of it's a
  bit of a spoiler to your whole life
  isn't it
  no no it isn't although you were
  quite a happy child weren't you fuck
  knows i've repressed it all
  so they didn't know that you would come
  into the world and just hate it i didn't
  know i would come into the world as
  demons born
  oh oh god i almost died
  unlike alexander liptanyenko
  who did you're listening to midweek
  murders
  prepare for a bumpy ride
  it's gonna be a barbie ride don't
  pretend
  like you know harry potter films
  i did know that one
  firstly
  that needs work i did it perfectly thank
  you very much
  exactly like you did
  oh feel slow
  oh i'm dying how how cheesy
  i'm dying already i'm afraid that we're
  gonna have to
  include the 9 11 moment
  because i died inside
  because that's the only dance we've got
  but people are gonna be so annoyed i
  mean
  how many american bots do we have
  listening like five
  more canadian than american which is
  funny
  yeah so they're not gonna care yeah true
  they're just gonna apologize under their
  breath and carry on listening
  sorry about it
  i was chat i was still in there sorry eh
  i was still in the shrunken head kind of
  dialect yeah with a little bit of
  swedish in there
  oh god i genuinely almost peed myself
  when i realized i had no because he
  couldn't work out
  simple math you know you don't know
  me you don't don't even know where
  when my birthday is you don't even know
  where i was
  [Laughter]
  i had born re-like sit and everything
  to not pee myself because i realized
  i had to practice my pelvic floor
  exercises
  i haven't done that since i was pregnant
  with the turtle that came out as a live
  birth
  i thought you were gonna say as a live
  bird
  turtles aren't birds
  well you say that but just because
  they're young are born in eggs doesn't
  mean they're a verb
  you're listening to midweek murders
  which means that it's time
  to talk about crime i'm your host sandra
  and with me is my pal you did it wrong
  and tell me how i'm supposed to just say
  i am your host sandra and then stop
  and then i can say and i'm your host
  don't leave me with just a one word
  response
  because i can't give my best with a one
  word reply this is simple
  economics fucking every week
  jesus christ and you've got a
  theater background do you ever write a
  script
  and you just have someone walk on stage
  and then just say
  hello and walk off again
  no because there's no drama with that
  when i leave you with the i'm your
  sandra
  you just don't see anything you don't
  stop
  you're like as i have to talk about
  crying i'm your host sandra and here's
  my friend
  joe that's the way uh-huh uh
  joe lies it no joe doesn't like
  it
  from the top final take midweek murders
  take two and action
  you're listening to midweek murders
  which means that it's time
  to talk about crime i'm your host sandra
  and i'm your co-host joe see wasn't that
  fucking hard was it
  you're the one who always makes it an
  issue
  because you fuck it up every week
  this week we're gonna talk about the man
  who solved his own murder and no
  it wasn't joe because i'm still alive
  and kicking
  so i got my information from a
  article in the guardian written by
  luke harding wikipedia
  and a bbc timeline
  of alexander litevinienko's
  death case i also got my
  information from the wikiwikibar
  inquiry which was chaired by sir robert
  owen who's that yo mama
  is that like a judge or a prosecutor
  is he's probably some kind of legal dude
  legal dude
  that's that's what we're gonna call him
  that's that's his uh technical job
  description okay
  so the last movement
  before alexander litvinienko
  ended up in the hospital was that he
  went to a lunch meeting
  with an italian dude that was
  very strange very strange he had
  a past of uh lying on a cv
  and not like the normal lying that
  everyone does
  a lot of lying he went to itsu
  a known sushi sushi
  it sounded like i called my mom by her
  nickname
  susie susie
  do it just like that susie
  oh yeah like that susie
  sorry i got distracted stop being weird
  about my mom dude
  i can't help it she likes it when i get
  frickin
  so they went to a known sushi restaurant
  called
  itsu a chain restaurant here in london
  and then he went to a meeting
  with one of his friends and a dude that
  he had only met once
  at the millennium hotel in london and it
  was funny because the
  guardian article was like yeah it was
  at the governor street
  i went to london once with my pals
  and we ended up in a taxi going back to
  our hostel where we were staying at this
  was before i lived here
  and i told the taxi driver
  that the hostel was on gross vendor
  street and he didn't get it at all he
  was like the what
  i was like the gross vendor street
  it's right by the thames he was like
  what the fuck are you talking about what
  do you mean
  i was like well if you just take us to
  the thames
  i'm sure we can work it out it's close
  to this tube stage
  and he was a yes okay when we got closer
  he was like
  oh you're trying to say grovner
  i was like is that how it's pronounced
  and i think he
  pissed himself he was laughing so hard
  end of anecdote are you peeing again
  no we just didn't find that funny i've
  heard the story before
  i know but the listener out hasn't sorry
  i thought you were expecting a reaction
  from me
  yeah but also like you're gonna have to
  follow
  [Laughter]
  [Music]
  [Applause]
  i'm stage trained i know i know
  and scene
  okay so that wasn't funny
  moving swiftly on
  [Laughter]
  he went to uh the pine bar
  in london's millennium hotel to meet one
  of his
  former friends from the federal
  security fucking shit
  i don't think that's their technical
  service
  federal security fucking shit
  service would definitely get arrested by
  the kgb if you called them
  i couldn't remember the last letter
  because
  i i'm thinking like fbi for some reason
  i'm i'm um you know
  brainwashed by the american media yeah
  what does the fbi stand for federal
  bureau of
  investigation gazinga
  you didn't think i knew that i did it
  would do
  if bureau was pronounced for yurio i not
  say that
  no you said burio
  god damn it okay
  so the the friend that he was meeting
  was andre lugovio
  le golf boy lego villa
  he's an italian russian guy
  andre lugoyov
  i knew it i i practiced all of these
  names before and i brought them down
  and then they turned italian
  okay so he went to
  the bar met his friend and then he also
  met dimitrov covten
  who he had only met once before
  and he said that he didn't like that guy
  because he had an appearance of
  being an alcoholic or a drug addict
  allegedly a little too russian for this
  russian guy's liking
  so when they were at the hotel he sat
  down
  with lego boy
  lugoyo lagoyov firstly
  who he knew from years before
  and lagoia told him like yeah
  we're gonna leave soon so there's no
  point in ordering anything but you can
  order something if you want
  or you could just have the tea that's
  left in the teapot
  here at our table so he was like okay
  so he poured the tea into his teacup
  he said that it there was only like
  half a cup left in the people and
  andre asked for a clean cup
  from the waiter so the waiter brought
  him a clean cup
  andre no alexander by the way
  alexander said to the investigators
  that he drank maybe three sips
  or four and then decided that
  he wasn't gonna drink anymore because it
  was green tea
  he said that it was without sugar
  which why would anyone put sugar in
  green tea but
  fair enough and he said that it was cold
  which is probably the worst part of that
  tea
  experience disregarding the poison
  obviously
  after that he went home
  and then starts to feel sick
  spends the night vomiting and with
  diarrhea and it doesn't
  get better so three days after that
  he gets admitted to the hospital
  and that first hospital that he was in
  was the barnett general hospital
  in north london because he lived in
  muswell hill
  which is very close to where i live
  don't take note of that russian bots
  you're the next target for the cramland
  yeah probably vladimir if you're
  listening we are one of you do not
  target us thank you please
  thank you please no i was gonna say that
  i don't think i'm ever gonna be able to
  visit
  moscow but i don't think i would want to
  either so that's fine i think you're
  also blacklisted apparently it's a
  very very pretty place oh yeah it's so
  pretty
  it is if you're a russian sympathizer
  well i see i've seen it on the on the
  google
  yeah i've been watching google i was
  like oh
  pretty pretty and catherine the great
  was also her sense of
  interior design let's call it that was
  supremely spectacular and pornographic
  added to the bucket list
  would be fun but we're probably never
  gonna get in now
  so you're just gonna have to live with
  that
  can you say that as though anybody's
  listening
  hi lee love you
  [Laughter]
  at the hospital well he's first in one
  hospital gets transferred for to the
  university college hospital
  in central london because he's placed
  in intensive care and also under armed
  police guard
  because they're starting to suspect
  a poisoning case first they thought it
  was
  salium please tell us a bit about that
  this is your role jose
  i have some information hit me with that
  hit me hit me fantastic
  hit me hit me hit me what
  was that a thing in the original song
  yes fucking google it bitch
  some of the clinical symptoms that he
  was exhibiting
  when he was admitted to hospital were
  synonymous
  with uh radiation poisoning in that he
  was losing his hair
  he had vomiting and kidney and
  renal failure and so they did
  quite a few extensive blood tests on him
  however they were quite quick
  to rule out thallium poisoning they did
  actually
  test his blood for it i think and found
  that
  the levels of thallium in his blood
  weren't clinically significant to
  indicate the symptoms that he was
  showing
  i don't actually know how long the
  thallium poisoning
  was a hypothesis i read
  that it was what he was treated for
  and then they realized that some of the
  symptoms that he was showing
  wasn't aligned with
  stallion poisoning yeah they treated him
  for thallium poisoning
  and they did i think it was an x-ray
  to look at bone density and things like
  that
  and they didn't see conclusive evidence
  of thallium poisoning
  other than what they'd administered to
  treat for it
  so i think and you can correct me on
  this
  i would be glad to i know you would
  little ravenclaw you that was
  patronizing.jpg
  they found and this is the part where i
  think you will correct me
  they found an ico taupe in his p
  that they first ruled out as like
  circumstantial
  and then they asked for a larger
  p sample urine sample sorry
  this is why i'm like a bit apprehensive
  about saying this
  but i think they ruled it out because
  there's
  polonium and things around us i was like
  where the fuck is the polonium in things
  around
  us i can't be circumstantial what
  is there polonium in things around us
  no but shortly no
  so what i think they probably found in
  his
  urine samples was lead
  yeah probably rather than polonium
  so when polonium degrades
  gives off all of its alpha radiation it
  turns into
  lead oh okay and it's perfectly normal
  to have
  small amounts of lead exposure to be
  found
  in blood and urine samples because there
  can't be
  like radioactive things around us so it
  must have been led well
  there are radioactive things around us
  all the time we have a base level of
  radiation exposure constantly
  when you rule out things like
  the gamma radiation from the sun which
  is
  radioactive exposure there's always
  a baseline level of radioactivity
  just from natural rocks
  and things i think so what you're seeing
  is that
  we are in the midst of making
  superheroes right that's what you're
  saying
  no
  you will i'm gonna have a baby you will
  not
  put it out turn into the hulk
  just from walking around
  no i know it was just it would have been
  funny though
  it wouldn't have been funny because we
  would have a shit ton of hulks
  my turtle bird baby is going to be the
  first symptoms your turtle bird baby
  is probably because you've been swimming
  around
  in nuclear sewage which is more
  likely to kill you than it is to make
  your offspring a superhero hey don't
  yuck my yum
  i don't know what that means but i'm
  gonna do it
  all right okay so i think the
  initial tests that were from
  litvinyenko's urine probably would have
  shown an abnormal amount of lead
  but also lead exposure is
  far more common than polonium exposure
  so any of that
  radioactivity that has degraded will
  have turned into
  a more common element and that's perhaps
  why they weren't
  so concerned to start with yeah
  a radioactive isotope poisoning i think
  they did
  ask for a larger urine sample they did
  blood tests
  too yeah just before he died and then
  they found
  out that it was polonium is that
  incorrect i don't know what
  tests they took in the hospital but i
  know his post-mortem results
  were pretty much conclusive they was
  polonium
  yeah fun fact maybe not fun because you
  seem
  to be a tough crowd tonight well i'm
  gonna tell it anyways
  is that sweden was the first country
  to expose the whole
  chernobyl disaster because
  they got pings in their thing imagings
  i'm pretty sure it was ukraine
  that was the first country to be exposed
  to the chernobyl disaster
  given that it happened in ukraine
  exposed
  i said expose no that's the same word
  i just realized i mean exposed it to the
  media oh
  so you mean detect yeah because russia
  well they
  knew about it in russia they just uh had
  it in a hush hush
  and then sweden was like because ukraine
  was part of russia
  back then yeah and then sweden was like
  wait a minute
  there's shit loads of radioactive thing
  imaging
  in the air this is not normal
  that's definitely not a fun story the
  chernobyl exposure was horrific
  very much an international disaster
  and then you're gonna tell me that 9 11
  was a
  date that i should have remembered just
  like your birthday
  apologies for the american bots for my
  co-hosts
  insensitivity to your national disasters
  it was horrible obviously i remember it
  when it was on the tv no you don't
  i do you thought it was in november you
  don't remember
  shit i remember seeing the news
  about it but not as it's ingrained in
  american
  oh say can you see
  by the dancer
  that's for you american bots love you
  guys
  i did also remember that my mom was like
  oh shit
  they've told us that like people born
  when my
  oldest brother was born has been
  affected
  by the radiation from the chernobyl
  disaster and i'm like yeah
  that's horrible obviously but she was
  afraid of
  my brother like afraid of his exposure
  to it
  i'm like he seems fine yeah i know
  people that need to have annual blood
  tests
  to determine their uh radiation levels
  to see if they're still alive
  it was definitely a thing that
  generations of people keep having
  problems with
  still to this day and i can't really
  understand that because of
  the fact that the polonium that
  alexander
  was poisoned with was
  so traceable and still
  it doesn't seem like that has been a big
  deal
  so in terms of the longevity of
  risk it very much depends on what kind
  of radioactive isotope you're dealing
  with
  so all sorts of different elements
  have different radioactive half-lives
  so the half-life of polonium
  is about 130 days i think 135 something
  like that
  which basically means that if you have
  one gram of polonium
  in 130 days it will have
  degraded enough to be half a gram
  of polonium and half a gram of whatever
  it degrades into i think in this case
  it's lead
  for other radioactive isotopes and we
  can use the example of radium
  radium has a half-life of 1005
  years oh so that's probably what
  happened in the chernobyl disaster like
  yeah and that's why particularly with
  these disasters
  that they're such high profile
  international concern because they're
  usually using things that have a longer
  half-life than polonium i think that's
  got
  quite a short half-life compared to most
  of the
  isotopes that are used in nuclear
  reactors
  because like i remember from the
  witness statement that they took from
  alexander before he died
  so he said that he sat at that table
  had the tea just a couple of clunks of
  it
  like swallows of it and then
  andre took his eight-year-old
  child to him and said this is your uncle
  sasha was
  which is like a nickname of alexander or
  like a
  term of endearment of alexander i think
  in russia
  and he said say hello to him and then
  his eight-year-old child
  shook his hand and then they went to a
  football game
  which was probably the cover of why they
  said they were going to the uk
  yeah and they used that as an excuse i
  think it was chelsea versus
  cska in moscow yeah or arsenal i don't
  remember
  but uh yeah it might have been arsenal
  yeah but also like
  when they realized that it was a
  polonium
  poisoning case the ma in
  the uk checked his
  sleeve from his suit that he was wearing
  at the
  on the day of the meeting and his sleeve
  was so radioactive
  so andre i don't know how much he
  knew about like the poison it felt like
  he was like yeah
  shake his hand eight-year-old son and
  the eight-year-old son dead
  but it was poisonous it's been
  hypothesized that both dmitry
  and andre didn't actually know
  how contaminated they would be
  by handling the polonium
  there's quite a lot both in the inquiry
  and on the wikipedia page there was a
  couple of different
  assassination attempts yeah they tried
  three times once in mid-october
  and they put it in his tea and literally
  didn't drink it the second was
  at the end of october the theory is that
  there were too many
  cameras around where they were trying to
  administer the dose and both of those
  occasions
  they ended up disposing of their
  polonium down the toilet
  and it was completely traceable
  so they found exactly the hotel room was
  contaminated with polonium
  the flights from moscow to london
  and london to moscow were contaminated
  so the theory is that both demetri and
  andre
  didn't actually know the
  level of risk that they were accepting
  when they took on the case of attempted
  murder and
  eventually successful murder of
  libernyanko i thought it was quite
  funny that the bb no the guardian
  article
  by luke cording said
  that assassins nowadays
  isn't really on the same like level
  of the assassins during the kgb
  and i thought that that was quite funny
  that it was like
  well they didn't do a very good job did
  they
  because it was like yeah they could
  trace all of this
  because of the radiation it was so
  clearly laid out
  for them yeah and when alexander told
  the investigators from the uk
  what had happened he obviously
  being a former secret agent
  know everything about like how to
  describe
  what he was doing at what day
  and how they looked and how they acted
  and what they did he remembered
  everything in clear detail
  and it's actually really interesting
  from a forensic point of view
  in that as far as i'm aware from what i
  could find in my research
  there is only one worldwide
  site that creates polonium
  210 for either scientific
  economic whatever kind of use there is
  only one place in the world
  that creates polonium 210
  and it happens to be exactly the same
  place
  that the polonium 210 that was used
  in the murder of
  was found and you can trace that back
  to the impurities that are found
  in that particular sample so
  polonium-210 isn't
  a naturally occurring substance you
  can't just like dig it out of the ground
  or extract it from the air it needs to
  go through
  a specific scientific process to be able
  to obtain it
  from things like bismuth and other
  things that are naturally obtainable
  and that polonium has like a specific
  fingerprint
  so you'll never be able to get pure
  polonium
  210 it will always have some kind of
  fingerprint
  with other kind of diluents and
  contamination effects and the only place
  in the world that produces it which is
  a specific site in russia also had
  the exact fingerprint of the polonium
  that was found
  to be used for litvinyenko's death yeah
  i found that
  interesting because it's like they don't
  even try anymore
  they don't care are you telling me you
  missed the days of the kgb
  no what i'm telling you is that
  because i'm sure there are plenty of
  russian bots out there
  that would argue the days of the kgb
  were absolute tyranny
  listen to our podcast you will be like
  yeah that's
  what we're trying to resurrect no i'm
  just saying that
  times bro good times what i'm saying
  is that they aren't even trying to cover
  their tracks
  as we said before the polonium was
  traced with the help of the cctv
  of the hotel to
  the two russian guys that he was in a
  meeting with
  they traced them with cctv up to the
  men's bathroom
  they knew exactly which cubicle
  they were in when they administered the
  poison to the tea
  they knew which table they sat at
  how much of the kitchen appliances that
  was
  contaminated at the time they
  knew about the one guy that he had only
  met once wait a minute i'm trying to
  look up the
  name
  computing dimitri kofton
  he goes up to his hotel room
  he tries to flush the polonium
  down the drain it gets stuck in the
  drain
  they trace all of this like they can
  find
  all of that because of the
  radioactiveness
  of the substance like it's not
  even hard and then
  why they do this i think is
  because they can't do anything the uk
  was like you need to
  extradite andre le go
  to the uk to stand trial for the murder
  they were not like no we won't do that
  but it's against russian law to
  extradite russian citizens so the
  russians said no
  and then the uk were like okay yeah but
  that's what i mean
  they they don't give a shit anymore
  because nobody
  can do anything well that's what happens
  when you vote conservative
  they invaded ukraine and then they were
  like what are you gonna do about
  it everyone was like oh this is horrific
  this is fine we don't need to get the un
  involved that's what i mean the whole
  purpose of the u.n
  is to protect all of its united
  nations but no no it's fine russia you
  can do what you like
  you're big and scary you've got a guy
  that fights bears without a shirt
  well that's what they always do but also
  like
  alexander poor guy he
  did his best to aid the investigation
  and to lead the
  investigators in the right track of
  who he had been talking to and meeting
  at the
  during the day and stuff like that but
  the problem
  is that alexander was like yeah you
  remember this world
  when i die that putin did this to me
  because he wanted to quiet down
  critiques of putin like
  he doesn't do that like putin is like no
  everyone who criticized me is dead
  and everyone is like okay like we all
  know
  what happened and yet nobody does
  anything about it
  and that is a bit concerning
  it's the same as the salisbury case that
  we covered previously
  in the it was an ex-russian spy
  who came to the uk and was given
  uk citizenship and protection
  and then some random guys from russia
  come over
  and attempt murder
  and just say that they're gonna look at
  football
  or the salisbury cathedral
  then everyone is like fine oh yeah
  like how obvious do you need to make a
  murder case
  if you're from russia before the uk
  government will be like
  okay this is a state-sponsored murder
  we're not okay with this
  how many people could have been poisoned
  at the hotel how many people in the
  nhs could have been poisoned at the
  hospital
  actually it's interesting that you
  should mention that
  because i've got a little bit of science
  in science you'll say oh
  oh yeah i hope you're sitting down
  because i'm about to blow
  your world
  so polonius which as aforementioned is
  the substance that was used to kill it
  vignenko
  actually doesn't have that higher
  toxicity
  when exposed to
  skin which is why the son
  of persons aforementioned logo boy
  lagoyev lagoyev
  [Music]
  [Laughter]
  that's why both lagoyev
  and coveton and all of the people
  that were involved in the murder weren't
  affected
  by the polonium themselves even though
  they left massive traces
  all across the world putin if you're
  listening
  sort your agents out they're fucking
  shit
  anyway the reason litvanyenko suffered
  such extreme conditions and eventual
  death
  compared to the agents that handled it
  is that the actual
  dermal exposure of polonium isn't
  lethal so polonium-210
  can actually only move through the skin
  about
  40 microns which is only a couple of
  skin layers deep so when you get exposed
  to it
  through contact on the skin it's
  not lethal the reason lit vanienko
  was murdered was because
  he ingested it through the t
  which then becomes internal
  exposure and becomes much more deadly
  yeah so it's interesting to know the
  lethal dose of ingested
  polonium versus how much they
  administered so the lethal dose
  uh the ld50 the lethal dose for
  a median of 50 of the population is less
  than
  one microgram from what i can tell
  it's uh 0.09
  micrograms your typical grain of salt
  so one single grain
  of salt is 60 micrograms
  so you picture a typical grain of salt
  from your salt dispenser 60 micrograms
  the lethal dose of polonium
  is 0.09
  micrograms so that three to four
  swallows of that tea
  was like 100 000 milligrams
  yeah what's even more interesting is
  when you
  convert micrograms into
  the standard unit for radiation which is
  becquerel
  it's 15 mega becquerels
  so 15 000 becquerels
  the dose that was administered into
  his t was 4.4
  giga becquerels oh good lord
  so they absolutely
  overwhelmed his tea with polonium
  and in his post-mortem
  they found 49 000
  becquerels per gram of tissue
  in his kidneys oh good lord so the
  kidneys main function
  is to filter your blood for toxins
  that's pretty much what your kidneys do
  and you pee it out afterwards
  so for the post mortem to find
  49 000 becquerels
  is basically equivalent to 49
  mega becquerels in his kidneys so that's
  what he has
  absorbed and filtered through his
  kidneys now remember that the lethal
  dose is
  15 mega becquerels
  and he had 49 mega becquerels
  just in his kidneys so he was
  absolutely annihilated
  with polonius they said that
  they can't treat radioactive
  or polonium exposure with prussian blue
  which i was like
  isn't that a cat that's a russian blue
  oh yeah yeah so prussian blue
  it's basically a generic
  radiation poisoning solution
  i wouldn't say it was a cure because it
  doesn't always work
  the prussian blue is actually what they
  detected
  in his x-ray when they treated him for
  thallium poisoning
  so they'd already administered the
  prussian blue
  to prevent the poisoning right back at
  the beginning when they thought it was
  thallium
  but obviously the dosages that he
  received was so
  high that there was literally
  nothing they they could have done to
  save him the post-mortem
  couldn't even identify a single cause of
  death
  they overall summarized that it was
  undeniably caused by polonium
  poisoning it was murder
  it was definitely murder
  but the final mode of death could have
  been any
  four number of factors so typically
  with radiation poisoning you would get
  bone marrow failure and in this case his
  bone marrow failure led to
  sepsis which increased his risk
  of cardio respiratory arrest you also
  get
  multiple organ failure and
  he also suffered direct radiation
  on the heart which caused the fatal
  heart rate
  which would have led to cardio
  respiratory arrest
  or it could have been a combination of
  all
  three of those factors and the reason
  why they can't
  rule any of those out is the way that
  alpha particles work in the postmortem
  these were described
  as a cellular bullet so it's essentially
  like firing a bullet on the cellular
  level
  in the it hits a cell and
  absolutely destroys it and just keeps
  on going until it runs out of energy
  yeah and it's also like i remember
  watching chernobyl
  and nicholas said that well it's a bit
  over the top how they cinematically
  like show the radiation
  poisoning symptoms but then i googled
  what does it actually look like and it
  was
  horrific like the actual yeah
  it really is so the chernobyl
  tv series i haven't seen it myself but
  from what i've heard they did
  a really accurate interpretation of what
  radiation poisoning looks like
  so what we expect from radiation
  poisoning
  is i think mainly from the media
  in terms of chemotherapy and
  radiotherapy
  in that we expect someone to have a bit
  of vomiting
  to lose their hair and their eyebrows
  and things like that
  and basically for most of their bodily
  functions
  to to start struggling when you're
  actually
  exposed to chernobyl levels of radiation
  or lithium levels of radiation
  if you take chernobyl the amount of
  radiation that was given off for those
  reactors
  is enough for people's skin to start
  sloping off yeah that's what happened in
  the series yeah
  people can lose their skin cells
  and it just starts peeling away from
  their body
  what litvinyenko experienced was
  mass internal organ failure
  you can kind of see that in the last
  photo of him
  before he died because he's very yellow
  yeah
  so the yellow will come from his
  liver failure so his liver was exposed
  to
  massive amounts of radiation which means
  it can't break down
  any of the bilirubin which causes
  jaundice
  it's the same with alcoholics once you
  start exhibiting liver failure
  you start becoming more jaundiced and
  you start
  showing that orange yellow hue
  a la trump
  i'm pretty sure that is like some kind
  of
  fake tan though oh that's definitely
  fake tan
  yeah unfortunately i wish he had liver
  failure
  and i don't really care it's mostly
  canadian
  bots and russian i'm not gonna say
  like i'm not gonna go into the whole
  reddit thing
  now but what i wanted to say is that
  people
  still think that he was
  killed by a russian oligarch that he
  was friends with that he put on the hit
  for him and i'm like please
  the evidence is overwhelming
  the evidence is overwhelming that
  coveton and lagoyev committed the crime
  of assisted murder
  it's still up in the air as to who that
  was
  authorized by there's been no
  overwhelming evidence that it was
  authorized by the kremlin
  well the mi6 records that were
  released like 10 years after his
  actual death kind of
  cemented the fact that it was
  ordered by the kremlin who's to say that
  a russian oligarch who wouldn't have had
  that power within the kremlin to also
  authorize that attack but i'm just
  playing devil's advocate here because
  we've got no definitive evidence to say
  that putin authorized this assassination
  even though the evidence overwhelmingly
  points in that direction in a uk
  court of law it's not enough to say that
  this was authorized
  by the kremlin but i would also like to
  say
  if any redditors are listening
  that the whole thing in russia they
  pointed the blame
  at alexander's friend who was
  ostracized and condemned by
  the russian government he lives in
  england because he's a political
  he had political asylum or he got
  like uh political asylums the right word
  yeah he was being prosecuted by
  putin and to point the blame
  on him is to say that well
  we didn't have anything to do with it it
  was his friend who also got his visa for
  him
  and who also paid his salary i just
  don't believe it
  because it feels like it's no and i
  think it's also interesting to note
  that once litvinienko was
  assigned asylum in the uk
  he was incredibly outspoken about
  putin's regime yeah to the extent that
  he was publishing
  books and journal articles and
  media reports about all kinds of
  different atrocities that were happening
  under the russian regime and
  like the salisbury case it seems to be
  like any kind of former russian agent
  that defects then becomes a target
  for putin's regime
  [Music]
  to silence effectively and i would also
  like to point out
  the fact that he was a
  employee of the mi6 to give them
  information about the russian government
  he also coined the phrase the mafia
  state
  to describe what putin does
  in russia he was also
  very outspoken about his friend getting
  murdered
  in russia because of her
  outspokenness against putin
  and he was also two weeks or one week
  away
  from testifying in the spanish court
  about like russian mafia
  and their connections to the kremlin
  in spain because the russian mafia
  was there as well and like i i would
  just like to get that said
  because i can't stand all of the
  conspiracy theories on reddit etc
  about like well no it wasn't putin
  alexander was like in too deep with his
  oligarch
  friend it's russian propaganda
  to say that he was killed by his friend
  well he was kind of killed by his friend
  i wouldn't
  i wouldn't go so far as to call nagoyav
  live in yamco's french well they kind of
  i would say they were colleagues yeah
  they were colleagues but they say
  the russian propaganda machine is saying
  that he was killed by his
  russian friend that was also ostracized
  which we completely support
  russian bots we are totally
  in agreement that he was murdered by
  his friend and we are not criticizing
  putin
  long live putin we should post that
  photo of him on a bear like shirtless
  that should be the image for this
  episode
  [Laughter]
  we're in compliance
  [Laughter]
  don't hate us we love you china
  free tibet wait what who said that
  oh god yeah have you seen those videos
  about people who are like
  yeah the best way to take care of your
  plants is to please
  free tibet
  please look up the thing with the
  muslim minority people who are getting
  oh yeah the
  uh i don't know how to pronounce it but
  it's spelled like voyagers
  actually it's it's interesting that you
  mentioned the
  muslim community in china the um so i
  presume you're sure
  you saw the drone footage of them all
  being led into trains with the shaved
  heads
  and all of that yeah probably it was
  that on reddit
  it was on reddit probably the bbc
  hosted an interview with the
  ambassador for china
  uh live in the studio they showed him
  this footage
  and he was like where did you get this
  footage this footage could have been
  from
  anywhere this what
  um and it took him like five minutes to
  come up with a reason and then he was
  like
  oh yeah no i've got it i've got it i've
  got it there's a
  i've got a perfectly rational
  explanation it's
  it's a prisoner transfer we do it all
  the time
  everybody does it it's completely normal
  just just
  ignore my five minutes of internal
  thinking
  where i come up for a rational excuse as
  to why we're
  literally being the nazis
  yeah yeah i know some of it
  like i've read some of the articles and
  the
  exposes about the situation it
  it seems super super super bad and now
  we're gonna be followed by the chinese
  spots as well
  well the more listeners the merrier
  yeah it's it's super bad
  in china i'm a massive supporter
  of kim jong-un
  i know it's north korea they're both
  communist
  dictatorships
  i thought you were gonna say they're
  both and then something way worse
  that comes
  well it's a true story brah true bro
  i mean you can leave that in i don't
  even care
  we're gonna be banned from so many
  countries just
  just put that at the beginning
  yeah so that's kind of
  it that's a story
  i feel like maybe i didn't say that
  alexander
  lit benienko saw
  his own murder by being like yeah
  i did this i met those people i did that
  and very and like described their
  outfits
  everything like he was a very very
  astute person well he was trained by the
  kgb back when they were good
  yeah and he also yes
  and he also said like apologies
  for ussr states who have been subjected
  to russian tyranny they're awful
  they've always been awful
  but also like they were terrible but
  long live russia but
  noah but what i wanted to
  say is that he was he was very good
  in his own investigation he was like
  yeah
  this is what happened blah blah blah yes
  he knew it'd been poisoned
  i feel like putin can do whatever he
  wants
  and people just not care obviously
  or he'll take his shirt off and wrestle
  you
  nobody wants that and it helps that
  his main political opposition
  is an orangutan in a wig
  and the biggest pile
  of humpty dumpty shit
  that the uk has ever elected to be a
  prime minister
  basically the only person that is
  holding putin
  in his place right now is angela merkel
  and to be fair i mean she's a very scary
  german lady
  but she ain't going last forever
  i wish i was more like trump he's
  obviously a bag of dicks but
  just because he's like everything he
  doesn't want to deal with he's like fake
  news
  and i'm like everything is shit
  it's just false media we're doing we're
  doing the greatest
  with kovid like all of these other
  countries
  they're just not even testing and we're
  doing
  the most testing and that's the reason
  why our numbers are so high is because
  we're just doing the most testing
  yeah oh i'm so sweaty
  i should i haven't taken my meds yet so
  i need to go get
  ready for be it thinking about me
  oh fucking house 10 past 11. yeah
  yeah jesus christicles jesus christicals
  jesus god bars it's happening
  god damn do you want to go say goodbye
  to the listeners
  oh i thought we'd
  [Laughter]
  [Music]
  love you see you next week bye

The poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, the man who solved his own murder, is the crime being discussed in this episode. Joe explains what effect polonium-210 has after being ingested, and Sandra forgets Joe's birthday. Sandra got her information from wikipedia and an article in The Guardian written by Luke Harding.
