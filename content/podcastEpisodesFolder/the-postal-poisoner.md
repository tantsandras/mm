#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

Do you want to know something interesting, historically, that you're not gonna find interesting, but I do?

I can't fucking wait for this anecdote, mate. \[Laughter]

Oh god. You're the only audience I have. I just read on unsolved mysteries that they don't actually know what Anne Boleyn looked like. Because Henry was like: "oh she's done all of these horrible things, we must execute her so that I can get a newer model of wife". People were like: "yeah, sure". So they executed her. And then Henry, in a fit of spite, destroyed all of her portraits. And getting caught with a portrait, or a sketch, or anything in the likeness of Anne Boleyn, was punishable by death more or less, like treason. So they destroyed all of her portraits and shit, so now nobody knows what she looked like. And all of the reports of what she looked like was written 400 years later, and then they were like: "oh well, she was heretic". So she had six fingers, and she was deformed. You know, all of that propaganda things that they do historically. It's quite interesting. 

But they made a tv show called the tudors, and she was in that. So how could they have made the tudors if they didn't know what she looked like. \[Laughter]

Well, obviously Elizabeth the first was her daughter, so I'm guessing she was brown eyed. Because Elizabeth the first had brown eyes, and Henry VIII did not. That's the gist of it.

That's all they've got. I heard a fun fact about Anne Boleyn.

What is it? 

She spent some of her life without a head. \[Laughter] 

No no, she was dead by then. Silly. That's where Elizabeth the first got it from, no head - must be from her mom. There was a better joke in there, I didn't reach it in time. 

I think that one worked better in your head. Unlike Anne Boleyn, because she didn't have one. \[Laughter]

Oh, that was a good one. Fucking hell.

\[Music]

Okay. So it's Wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra. 

And I'm your host Joe.

Got it in five! 

Even when I do it, you still laugh at me.

This week we're gonna talk about the most horrible serial killer that you've never heard of, Francis Edward Drescher. I got my information from Harold-Democrat from 1915, St Louis Post-Dispatch from 1915, Elkhart Daily Review from 1915, and Evansville Press from - you guessed it - 1915. I would also like to extend a special thanks to reddit user the bones of autumn, without whom I would not have ever heard of this case. I don't think they listen to the podcast, but if they do, thank you very much. 

Was that the post from two days ago?

Yeah, probably. 

That's the one that I used for one of my references.

It's a good write-up. If anyone's on reddit, highly recommend the post. 

....Hello? 

Hello. 

Oh, I'm waiting for your references. 

Oh! Reddit. A newspaper that's been archived in the library, and I didn't make a note of who wrote it or what newspaper it was in. A book, Francis Drescher strychnine, or strychnine, however you want to pronounce it. We probably need to come to a conclusion on that.

Oh. I thought it was pronounced strych-nine.

I would probably go with strychnine.

Cool.

And the wiki wiki wah. 

Are you sure about that? Because I've always heard it as strychnine when other people talk about it.

I am as sure as I am sexually virile.

....So not at all? \[Laughter] Speaking of which, I should just ask, the other one...

Quinine. 

Quinine, okay. 

Yeah. No wait, that one is definitely pronounced quinine.

Yeah. 

So then I would say that it would be strychnine, because they both have nine on the end.

Yeah, it would make sense, I've just never heard it like that.

Well, you say it however the fuck you want then. This is your podcast.

I might have just heard it in America, so it might be American... 

America, fuck yeah!

Okay. 

Yeah, I would like you to pronounce it strychnine.

Mhm. So Francis Edward Drescher, let's talk about the name first and foremost. He is... 

Very germanic. 

Yeah, but he is mostly referred to in the newspapers as either Francis Edward Drescher, Francis Drescher, or Edward Drescher. So I'm not actually sure what his first name is, but... 

Francis. 

All right, let's go with that.

It was on his death certificate, so. 

Oh yeah.

I think that's a fairly reputable source.

It was on his grave, I saw the photo. Although in some newspaper articles he is referred to as Edward Drescher, but lets go with Francis. I've written Drescher because I wasn't sure. Francis Edward Drescher, a coroner and part-time undertaker in Owen County Indiana, was found dead in his library...

\[burps]

Was found dead in his library by his wife Estella, on the evening... \[Laughter]

I just like how you chose to keep that in: "he was found dead in his library". 

Library!

I don't know why we're talking like this, because Indiana is not in the south. 

It's like Washington, isn't it? There abouts? I don't know, I shouldn't say anything about it. Geography, it's beyond me!

Even though your favorite show is a geography quiz show.

I know, right? I'm full of... contradictions! That's the word. 

Full of hypocrisy. \[Laughter]

By his wife Estella, on the evening of the 2nd of June, you guessed it, 1915. 

I'm sensing a theme.

He was estimated to have been alone for a mere hour before his body was discovered, as he had suggested to his children that they should go and watch a movie at the nearby cinema. Found with his body was a note he had written to his wife, stating: "I ate a radish and my heart has broken. It hurts me today. Pocketbook. Goodbye mom and children". Reportedly it was a bit unintelligible, so they couldn't read if he said: "my heart has broken", or: "my heart has bulked".

I'd lean towards bulked, rather than broken. That makes a lot more sense having eaten a radish. Radishes, what even are they? Murderous, that's what they are. I knew I shouldn't be eating them.

How big was the radish? Did he swallow it whole? Nobody knows. 

Not sure those are the most pertinent questions that arise from this case, but okay, everybody has their own research methods. \[Laughter]

A better question would have probably been - why does it say pocketbook in the middle of it? 

I have a theory as to why it says pocketbook, and it's completely unfounded, and not supported with any evidence. But my thought is, his wife was in on his killing spree and knew that he wrote down the names of his victims, or potential victims, in his pocketbook. I feel like radish is probably a code word.

Oh yeah, maybe. 

Like: "I ate a radish", means: "I took the strychnine". And pocketbook is like: "dispose of the pocketbook, otherwise they're gonna poop in my grave".

That might be a good theory. So Drescher was under suspicion for a large number of poisonings, as the town of Spencer Indiana had experienced several cases of people who had died after receiving parcels of "free samples" of quinine. An investigation into these murders had begun, and Drescher had reportedly heard a rumor that he was to be arrested on the 3rd of June, which could explain why he decided to kill himself on the second. It could, it could. We don't know. A federal officer had been in town to look into the poisonings, and Drescher was reported to have been much alarmed in the days leading to his body being discovered. I thought it was funny that they said "much alarmed".

Suspicious. 

Suspicious, oh ja. So these parcels, the parcels with quinine, on the bottles there was a typewritten label on top of the normal label which said "free sample" on it. So people just took these. So I'm guessing they didn't have, like, a steady supply of medications? So they were like: "all right, fine. Free medicine! Okie dokie".

"Oh! I got free pills in the post. I'm just gonna pop these in my mouth and hope they don't kill me!".

"And hope for the best!". Wait, have we talked about qui-nine? 

Quinine. 

Quinine.

No. 

What the fuck is quinine? \[Laughter] What is quinine, sorry.

Quinine, historically, was an anti-malarial drug. 

What?!

Yeah. So from its discovery... Well, from its european discovery, until about 2006 it was the leading drug used to tackle malaria. But also, has a shit ton of side effects. Some of which can be quite severe. 

But why did people in 1915 take qui-nine?

Quinine! Was taken... \[Laughter]

Quinine, sorry. 

I can only imagine it was taken because it's got analgesic properties. So it's a painkiller. I'd imagine it's the same theory behind taking paracetamol when you've got a cold, in that it can make you feel a bit better. But what tends to happen with these kind of drugs, is they get marketed as a miracle cure for everything. 

Okay.

So they'll find something that works really well with one thing, in this case malaria, but because it also has analgesic properties they're like: "well, why not take it for your aches and pains? Why not take it for your flu? Why not take it for a headache? Why not take it for conjunctivitis?". Don't take it for that, it's not an antibiotic. \[Laughter]

Okay. 

Interestingly, quinine has been, I don't know if it still is, an ingredient in tonic water. The theory.... 

What? Wait! I heard...

All right, you do the pharmacology side of this podcast then! \[Laughter]

I just wanted to add, that I heard somewhere that gin and tonic was invented because of malaria. 

Yeah. 

Cool!

I don't know how reputable this story is. But theoretically, back in the colonial days when Great Britain liked to invade everyone and pretend they were ours, when we did that in Asia the troops needed to take anti-malarials. And the anti-malarial was quinine. So what they would do is drink a solution of quinine, find that "oh, this is horribly bitter", and add some gin to it. And thus, the gin and tonic was born.

Historically interesting. Oh. 

Which is why I say that I don't know if it's still an ingredient in tonic water. Because quinine is now no longer first choice as an anti-malarial, we've synthetically made drugs that are just as effective and less side effect nasty. 

Which is the clinical term, obviously. 

Yeah. There's three different types of parasite that can cause malaria, and one of them is quinine resistant, one of the other ones is modern drug resistant, so you still have to use quinine to be able to get rid of it. The reason quinine was dropped as first choice is because common side effects are: headaches, tinnitus, vision problems, and sweating. I mean, that's pretty much my life. \[Laughter]

I can relate, yeah. 

Severe side effects can lead to deafness, an irregular heartbeat - which can lead to cardiac arrest, and low blood platelets. Which means, if you get a cut you're at risk of bleeding out, because you can't clot properly. 

Oh no. That would be really bad for you, because you're allergic to plasters. 

And that would be like the royal family all being hemophiliacs, and a good statement for why inbreeding shouldn't be allowed.

Is that true? 

I think in Vicky's time they were all hemophiliacs. Because, you know, they married their cousins and shit. 

Of course, of course. They do tend to do that.

Yeah, because they're all from Norwich. I can say that, because I live with someone from Norwich. \[Laughter]

Of course. So these parcels had led to

the deaths of

six physicians according to one

newspaper article

as well as frank mason alice mchenry

and a traveling man by the name of d.h

johnson who had walked into a hardware

store and died

without having gotten a word out

dresher had been the coroner who

examined the bodies of these last

three and had decided that no inquest

into their deaths

needed to be made they were all

concluded to have died of symptoms

caused by stricken

poisoning although this was not under

death certificates and i'm going to give

some examples of that

now in the home of frank mason

they had found a small amount of

strychnine on a piece of paper

and although frank had bellowed i'm

poisoned doc

quick get me out of here before dying

didn't he say get it out of me yeah what

did i say

get me out of here oh \[ __ ] like he was a

celebrity in the jungle

i'm poison doc quick get it out of me

before dying dresher decided that the

cause of death

was suicide side note why

this was recorded was that dresher

wasn't the doctor on site another

doctor had been called when frank had

fallen

acutely ill with convulsions and stuff

and he said that to that doctor

but dresher was the coroner so alice

mchenry had been suffering from a

headache at school and when she came

home

her grandmother had given her a tablet

of creamin

tablet of quinine she had received in

the post

alice died 20 minutes later and dresher

noted

the cause of death down as cerebral

hemorrhage nasty way to go

also like what but alrighty then

it would account for her previously

recorded symptoms of headaches

so i think what he's done is picked a

condition

that post autopsy you couldn't prove

that

matched her clinical symptoms oh

i didn't know you couldn't prove that

and now i feel like maybe we could talk

about

what's stricken well i've got more names

so

maybe we could talk about them to the

names

\[ __ ] it hell i still don't know what

strict it

does and because i haven't looked it up

patients wear their patients i don't

have any i like to do things

chronologically

i'm gonna listen back to this one and be

like no tell me about who died

strychnine is a neurotoxin

this one works on the spinal cord

and in the particular part that controls

muscle contraction oh that's why you

have convulsions

yeah your normal bodily response would

be

to have an impulse triggered at the

nerve

which causes your muscles to contract

and then a

molecule called glycine will bond to

your receptor

basically raising the required potential

for that neurons fire again

so it stops firing and your muscle

relaxes

that's how normal muscle contraction

works so strictness works by

binding onto the same receptor that

glycine does

so you get your impulse at the nerve

triggers the muscle response to contract

and then there's no

glycine available to bind so you stay

contracted

which like you said is why one of the

main symptoms

is convulsions it can lead eventually

to asphyxia which is suffocation

is that because your throat muscles

contract as well

not your throat muscles but your

respiratory muscles

so things like your diaphragm and your

intercostal muscles between your ribs so

everything that

controls the expansion of your lungs and

the retraction of your lungs

stops working you essentially stop

breathing

it's most commonly used or only used

as a pesticide it has no medicinal

benefits

at all so it's not like a medicine that

can be prescribed

that has nasty side effects it is just

a pesticide could it be bought at that

time

like at the store as a pesticide yeah

and you go through a couple of

stages of symptoms first round of

symptoms

is a nervousness and restlessness

muscle twitching and a stiff neck so not

too severe

and then it starts to get a bit nasty so

then you start to suffer from the

convulsions

extended limbs dilated pupils not so bad

and then this one bear with me a pistol

which is basically your body goes into

such a rigid state

that if you are laying flat on your back

and then

arch upwards so that only your heels

and the back of your head are touching

the floor oh

like in the horror films yes

i guess every time they do a horror film

about like possession

yeah yeah yeah yeah so pretty much like

that an inverted

arch but completely involuntary an

important thing to consider is that

it is rapidly absorbed from your

gastrointestinal tract so if you

administer it orally supposedly about

50 percent of the dose is absorbed into

tissue

within five minutes oh god that's so

quick so pretty nasty stuff and you

don't need a very high dose

obviously there's no human testing on it

because it's orible

but anywhere between 30 and 120

milligrams

your standard paracetamol tablet is 500.

and that is

the murders appears to have started with

a woman named maud

clark who was working for the drescher

family as a mid and

nanny nine years before the

investigation into the poisonings

had started maude had been left alone

with

thresher for several days and one

morning she

suddenly started convulsing and died

half an hour later

hand clenched around mr drescher's

trousers

in the laundry room a few days after

mart marred

a few days after maude was murdered

a dr gray the coroner investigating

maud's death fell seriously ill

and was admitted to hospital his entire

family had fallen ill

but fortunately they all recovered

stricken

was found in a sugar bowl on the great

family dining table

but the mystery of where the poison had

come from

was never solved due to lack of evidence

although dr gray suspected mud to have

been

a victim of poisoning drescher had

convinced

a second coroner that maude must have

poisoned herself

due to being depressed or as he said

often

sad and no autopsy was done

i'm surprised that nobody was like wait

a second

well he was the county coroner so he's

in a position of power yeah

so an autopsy of dresher was performed

by

dr peterson who removed his stomach and

sent it off to the state board of health

in indianapolis for examination

there an analysis of the stomach by

dr noble found that no radishes

or stricken was present in the stomach

of dresser

dr noble stated that death frequently

is caused by poison which has passed

through

the stomach so i'm guessing the thing

that you said

that it's absorbed very quickly i would

like to know

why under these suspicious circumstances

they didn't examine the liver or kidneys

yeah that's a good question he was under

suspicion of suicide

from ingestion of poison you assume

he takes it orally so you check his

stomach oh

nothing in there what's the next key

organ

that i don't know filters out your blood

it might be those funky things at the

back called kidneys

what chop them out stick them in the

post with the stomach

be like have a look geez anything in

there

comes back ah yeah bunch of \[ __ ]

strychnine in there in there

you mean there's a natural filter system

in the body that might have processed

the poison

what that might have actually tried to

take toxins

out of his blood system like you know

their entire functional purpose

or given that strictness is mainly

eluted in the urine you know they might

have looked into that

organ that specifically filters out your

urine so that you're only bypassing

anything to waste

what you mean there's an organ in the

body

ah what is that one called oh it's the

main

it's the \[ __ ] liver

i think that maybe they checked her

stomach and then

no natural causes

it was officially ruled as a suicide so

i'm guessing

they still thought that the poison just

had been

absorbed or is that because they

couldn't find

anything else as he got a bullet hole

in his head oh which \[ __ ] to hedge

governor

do you mean there's an organ for the

edge it's the bit of the top that does

the thinking

oh no that bear looks alright what must

have been suicide then

case closed clean them up i think that

it was probably the no as well they were

like i know

must be a suicide well everyone knows

radishes are \[ __ ] poisonous

what's that lunatic doing eating

radishes

he was a \[ __ ] doctor he should have

known bear

\[ __ ] red man nature's sign of poison

obviously you ever eaten a

no you haven't cause they're red why

would you eat a radish

the motive behind dresher's many alleged

murders

is unclear though some people speculated

that he might have committed these

murders to increase his

undertaker business some cases seem to

have been more personal

william blair for example an undertaker

working in patricksburg had received one

of these free

sample bottles of quinine in the post

oh did you hear that \[ __ ] nailed it

mate

oh hold on i need to bash one out

yeah told investigators that dresher had

been angry with him

as dresher believed that the undertaking

jobs that blair had been taking on

should have gone to him charles

serber told investigators that before

defeating

thresher for a nomination in the

democratic primaries

he had been warned that he would not

live to hold the office

if elected server had received a free

sample bottle

shortly before the election but had

noticed

that the cork had been tampered with and

had turned

it in to the police good lord

oh it was going so well i know right at

the state laboratory

at the state laboratory

i just love the library and laboratories

at the state laboratory where everybody

is smoking a pipe

they concluded that the bottle contained

enough stricken

to kill six people when this

reached the news several other

politicians

reached out to police over having

received the same kind of bottle

in the post jason stuckey

oh so plucky jason stacky had also been

on the receiving end of the world's

shittiest parcel and told police that he

and dreshert had had

a quarrel shortly before the package

of death had arrived and

as a side note they were all clearly

labeled with the

free sample type written label over

the quinine pharmaceutical label so they

were all the same

once it reached the papers that someone

was sending

poison 26

individual residents also reported

getting free quinine in the post oh god

yeah

so dresher really covered his bases

it was like why poison the water well

when i can just send them each

an individually postmarked letter with

the poison

and also i'm shocked at how many names

there were

in some articles there were like six

physicians

and these other victims and in other

articles it was like and this one and

that one

i think a lot of the names come

from people collating not necessarily

autopsy results of strychnine poisoning

but suspicious deaths under which

dresher was the coroner yeah that could

have been it yeah

so cw edwards another undertaker

had told investigators that he had found

a bottle of whiskey on his doorstep one

day

with a note saying that the whiskey was

from a friend

but edward noticed that the friend's

signature was

off and suspicious because of the ford's

signature he had turned it into police

who discovered

that the whiskey contained large amounts

of stricken

and this is where both you and i would

have been dead or at least

whiskey

because i do not recognize the

handwriting of my friends

you know mine well if it was

scrawled in a elizabethan ladies

handwriting that's probably joe

but most of you might listen lady

very good handwriting whereas if i

received

a bottle of chicken scrawl

not yet melisandre

just a story but i would have been dead

because i would not

recognize my friend's handwriting you

wouldn't have even read the label

\[Music]

you'd have been bottle of whiskey

where's the ice

not even that because you don't have ice

with your whiskey

bottle of whiskey where's my tumblr now

\[ __ ] it ship ship ship ships

i would have read the label and been

like probably

from whatever friend that said and you

would have read the label and then been

like oh \[ __ ] it free whiskey

yep yep but

then probably would have had a bit

realized it tasted

horribly bitter and drank the rest

anyway

so uh if anybody's looking to murder me

my favorite brand of whiskey is talisker

russian bots were listening or taking

notes

this is the wish if you want to stab me

with a talisker-injected

umbrella then go for it i have got

plenty of ass to aim for

oh god it's true it's sad but it's true

actually that's the point where you're

meant to say no no you got a tiny

ass not

it's true i didn't mean your ass i'm at

the weight

poisonous

just like your ass

walk into a room and everybody's like

damn

that is jiggly that's a meaty backside

right there

so the list of dressers possible victims

is

extremely long and in one newspaper

article it said that the citizens of

owen county

held dresher responsible as

drescher led the inquest into these

deaths

and buried most of the bodies francis

edward drescher was believed by

investigators to have played a role

in the poison by a male plot that had

taken so many lives in

owen county but they did not believe

that he had acted alone

after his death three more cases of

stricken

poisonings happened and although several

citizens had turned in their free sample

bottles

to police i think you said 23.

26. crazy after the story hit the news

no new parcels were ever discovered to

have been

sent out so those three

obviously either had delayed delivery

which if it were by royal mail not

unexplainable or

saw their parcel popped it down on the

side and thought

i'll save that for ron yeah i think they

probably saved it for later when they

had the flu or something yeah saved it

for ron

what's the wrong later on oh should have

gotten that

wasted on you i made that joke last

episode as well and it flew over your

head

how do you even remember that last

episode was

four hours because i only have

five jokes

anyway back to the case i think that was

it maybe i should say that

and that's the case

now for something completely different

you should put that on the end because

that is a classic

monty python flying circus maybe we

should say

bye thank you so much for listening to

midweek murders we'll see you next week

Bye bye! 

Ciao!
