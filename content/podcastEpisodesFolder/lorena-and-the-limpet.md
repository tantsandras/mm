  Midweek murders contains graphic and
  explicit content,
  listener discretion is advised. Somebody
  once
  told me the world has gone around me
  i aint the sharpest tool in the shed...
  Joe!
  [Laughter]
  I helped you out. Wow.
  I should be a recording artist, I know.
  hashtag some moron in the place where i grew up...
  Upplands Vasby. No!
  You know that ain't the truth.
  Gonna get to the stage where that's
  gonna be
  genuinely where i thought you grew up.
  And i'm gonna believe you.
  Oh no, wait, did I?
  [Laughter]
  I think some moron put alcohol
  on a tampon and put that up their butt.
  It was a boy obviously.
  You say obviously...
  They tend to be a bit careless. Is
  that just because of all of the stories
  of
  women putting vodka soaked tampons
  anywhere
  revolve around the vagina? I don't think
  they would do that. It has
  definitely been done. The ph
  balance is so fragile, I don't know how
  that would
  turn out. I mean they didn't enjoy it.
  Very badly, I'm assuming.
  I can 100 percent assure you that I have read
  AE reports where people have put... Oh
  good lord. Spirit
  soaked tampons in their
  hoo-ha.
  Speaking of... We're not allowed to say
  that word live on
  air. Speaking of the va-hoo-ha
  the episode... VA-HOO-HA! I'm saying va-hoo-ha
  what more do you want?! Jesus christ,
  fucking immigrants.
  [Laughter]
  Let me have my natural segway that you
  just
  talked over! Speaking of the va-hoo-ha, play the jingle.
  [Laughter]
  What I was gonna say is...
  No leave it in, you can't top that.
  Are you sure you haven't been drinking?
  I do have water, I'm not an animal.
  Of course you do,
  because you're so dry. You're listening
  to midweek murders
  and this week we're going to discuss
  the case... it already went to shit.
  Speaking of which, natural segway,
  no I'm just kidding. Play the jingle!
  Take it seriously man, this is our
  livelihood at stake.
  It is if you keep not hitting your sales target.
  Well if you'd have set up a go fund me
  by now we could be bajillionaires.
  I don't think bots have money.
  Just like me. I should just become a bot! Would we legally be able to accept
  payments from the russian government?
  I don't know, let's say yes.
  I know a lawyer, I'll ask her. Yeah
  if it comes straight from Putin's va-hoo-ha then maybe not. It means vagina.
  Okay welcome to midweek murders,
  this week... oh shit.
  It's wednesday, and that means it's
  time to talk about crime, but you know
  that already bots because you've been
  listening to all of our episodes.
  Thank you AI and elon musk.
  I'm your host sandra and this is your
  host
  Joe. You did it again, you left me with
  fuck all to say.
  What am I supposed to say? 
  You said it that way last time so I
  thought that was
  a okay. But some fussy little princess
  sitting in his tower... I'm sitting in my
  bed
  actually, and just because it's on the
  fourth floor
  doesn't mean it qualifies as a tower.
  I've checked.
  Okay what do you want me to do? Also, I
  introduced you that way last time
  to make you feel deliberately
  uncomfortable so that you would
  appreciate the position that I'm
  in whenever you introduce me that way.
  Oh it was your british
  passive aggressiveness shining through.
  And if that didn't work
  then please see my statement of 10
  seconds ago.
  What do you want me to say? Hey dudes
  [Laughter]
  this is my dude Joe,
  and this is my dude Sandy G.
  Sandy G in the house!
  In the house!
  Do we have any working version of that
  now?
  I don't think we have. Why don't we
  [Laughter]
  just throughout the whole podcast
  through the whole
  40 minutes, but no it's gonna be more like
  two hours,
  but through like the whole two hour
  recording just
  genuinely snip out the individual words of
  the introduction. You're, listening,
  to, midweek, murders,
  that means it's time to talk about
  crime. I'm gonna use that one.
  I'm your host sandra, and I'm
  your host joe.
  Perfect. Nailed it in one.
  They do call me one take juan
  on on the film sets that i'm on.
  Introduce the case! Okay this week we're
  going to talk about
  bobbitt versus bobbitt, and the dancer
  not the weirdest thing that has happened
  in in media after that i can say that
  john bobbitt has been participating
  in very very strange things
  on the internets well not on the
  internets
  on the tv but now it's on the internets
  because everything you do stop saying
  internets
  [Music]
  everything it's just the one man
  try that for math but you wouldn't have
  it
  that's because it's mathematics
  tell that to the americans it's not
  the internets you know i've
  written that on the website right well
  it's not the internet
  no i've written my no
  i've written my interests include the
  interwebs
  with a c because
  like that pubs
  and joe's dog ollie where the fuck does
  the
  sea come in in interwebs no i mean said
  what oh i don't know the alphabet you
  know
  it escapes i am
  hashtag confused
  and you're gonna be more confused
  because i'm gonna tell you about the
  case
  of marina bobbitt versus john bobbitt
  or as it's known more commonly in the
  media
  the dick chopping case it started
  with once upon a time in the land
  not far away depending on where you're
  situated in the world
  a man called bobbitt and a lady
  called bobbitt had a little
  fraca in the bedroom
  what is fraca google it bitch
  okay
  sorry you you do your shit it's starting
  to shit talk
  oh for fuck's sake let me finish so you
  don't have to keep
  cutting me out
  [Laughter]
  okay
  god damn it it's that one was on purpose
  that one was an accident oh did you have
  another
  [Laughter]
  but guess who does not john bobby
  not true he does they surgically
  reattached it
  yeah spoilers so it started
  on the 23rd of june
  1990 yes
  with a 9-1-1 call where there was a
  woman
  telling the police that
  she had cut her husband's penis
  off and she also told them
  that she had thrown the penis out of the
  car
  while driving i mean who hasn't made
  that call
  at least once in their lifetime
  maybe in our fantasies then
  the firefighters and the police
  searched for the penis on the curb
  of the road where she said that the
  firefighters were called because they're
  used to handling
  big hoses
  spoilers seen the picture the
  firefighters were not required
  [Laughter]
  okay so so i think
  a police officer accidentally stepped
  on the penis no way yeah
  which i genuinely didn't know that
  which also figures in your fantasies
  extensively
  i can only imagine only if he was
  wearing high heels
  and then he told or maybe it was a
  firefighter
  somebody stepped on the deck and then
  they as long as there's a service man i
  don't mind
  and then they bagged it
  took it to the hospital it was washed
  with antiseptic
  and packed in saline eyes and then
  surgically reattached to john bobbitt's
  stump after nine hours of surgery
  yes if you're listening to this ladies
  and gentlemen
  and considering penile amputation
  it takes nine hours
  to reattach true story bro
  and i should also say that i got my
  information
  from wikipedia and a documentary series
  on amazon prime called
  lorena uh i got mine from
  also wikipedia and encyclopedia.com
  does dollars when she was arrested
  she told the police he always have
  orgasm
  he doesn't wait for me ever to have
  orgasm
  he's selfish this conversation
  with detective peter wentz was
  tape recorded and then read on the trial
  so let's start with the trial that came
  first the trial that came first was
  the trial against john
  bobbitt for his
  i think the charge was like
  marital abuse
  there was a a rape charge in there as
  well
  yes so at the trial
  they told lorena and her defense
  that they could only because of the the
  way that the loss
  was at the time in
  virginia i think it was
  was that she could only
  discuss or present evidence
  from five days within the
  incident or maiming or amputation of the
  penis
  happened so they were not allowed to
  talk about or present evidence from any
  other time than just those five days
  which for me is quite crazy yeah that's
  that's a
  pretty messed up law yeah then
  what happened at that trial was that
  the defense said the defense for john
  bobbitt said
  that lorena had been
  angry and he was asleep
  he constantly repeated the fact that he
  was dead tired blah blah blah
  and then she had just chopped his dick
  off and he didn't even kind of notice
  like well he noticed obviously but like
  he was so
  tired in air quotes that he said that he
  kind of just remembered her holding her
  his penis and then the
  mutilation happened and he was like what
  the hell
  the prosecution stated
  that he had been sexually assaulting
  raping abusing lorena
  in their marriage but they couldn't
  present
  evidence enough evidence for this
  because they were only allowed to
  present
  evidence from the five days
  that were around the incident
  although i would say that they could
  have found evidence against him
  during those days if they had looked
  further
  into it they did have several
  people that provided character
  witness statement against him and things
  that he had said
  i don't know if that falls into the
  remit of the five days but there was
  definitely somebody
  who testified in the first trial
  to say that there was an
  established history of abuse
  both mental and physical against john
  bobbitt
  yeah i think that was the second trial
  though
  because they weren't allowed to talk
  about past er
  happenings as i saw in the documentary
  series
  the only evidence that was
  presented was that she said that he had
  raped her
  before the incident with the knife
  happened
  wait so hold on let me ju just to try
  and get this clear in my head
  so there were two prosecutions
  one was against lorena
  for chopping his dick off yes
  and the other was against john for
  serial domestic abuse yes and
  as you said rape as well and yeah so
  which
  which one went to trial first the
  prosecution against
  john bobbitt went first so the serial
  domestic abuse rape charges
  yes no well yes but
  the character witness to say that
  he was a massive sex pervert
  was definitely in his trial no
  that was as a defense for lorena
  a defense for her temporarily
  temporarily temporary
  insanity plea she pleaded not guilty on
  the grounds of temporary
  insanity okay sauce
  fine i was also confused why
  his he was on trial for the rape that
  happened before she chopped his dick off
  it's called like marital abuse or
  something like that
  yeah virginia law at the time was weird
  i have a specific point about that but
  we can bring it up when we're not
  just bringing me up to speed no you can
  say it now is it the first trial or the
  second
  so it was the trial against him yeah for
  his rape and sexual abuse and
  he was acquitted on
  those charges and the reason
  he was acquitted or one of the reasons
  he was acquitted
  was because under virginia law
  at the time the legal definition
  of rape was that it only applies to
  couples
  living apart or in cases where the
  victim
  suffers serious physical injury
  so because they lorena and john were
  sharing a home
  and lorena didn't have any serious
  physical injury
  it couldn't legally be classed
  as rape yes fucked up it's so fucked up
  but an interesting point about the
  forensic science bit
  was that i messaged you yesterday when i
  was watching the documentary
  it was a forensic scientist who gave
  expert testimony
  about the fact that she said that he had
  ripped
  her panties off and he said
  that he looked at the tearing
  of the fabric of her underwear and
  said that it had been cut most likely it
  had been cut he didn't say
  100
  and you say that it's very easy to see
  if it had been cut or not yeah
  it's incredibly easy to tell
  forensically
  if a fabric or material has been cut
  versus
  ripped or shred and to give you
  an analogy if you've ever tried
  to sew something and
  have bitten your thread
  and tried to thread that through the eye
  of a needle
  versus if you've snipped your thread
  with scissors
  and tried to put that through the eye of
  the needle
  i don't know if you've ever done both of
  those
  of those and i would just like to say to
  all of the listener bots
  that i can't do both
  all right this isn't a platform for your
  home care
  bragging i didn't know that it wasn't
  you have to tell me this from the top
  shouldn't put it in the contract joe
  most people present company excluded
  would find that the thread that has been
  bitten or ripped is much harder
  to thread through the eye of a needle
  than one that's been cut
  and that's the same with fabric or
  papers or whatever
  under a microscope a rip or a tear
  is really jagged and it has lots of
  sharp edges
  and it's really obvious to see that it's
  been torn apart
  whereas a cut is literally just slicing
  through the fibers so it's very straight
  it's very neat it's really equal on both
  sides
  so the forensic evidence of underwear
  of being ripped versus being cut
  would be really really clear-cut and the
  only reason
  the expert witness has said that it's
  most likely to have been cut
  is because in these kind of situations
  you can't
  100 guarantee anything
  but if the forensic witness
  has said that the evidence shows that it
  was more than likely cut
  then that is what i would be inclined to
  believe
  had happened yes and the problem with
  that i think
  is that it didn't correlate her
  police report it wouldn't have been a
  problem if she said
  the panties were cut but it was a
  problem because she said the panties
  were ripped
  and the thing is that it's very very
  common
  in domestic abuse cases that
  when they first do the police report
  the victim will often underplay the
  situation
  so the victim will say like oh he pushed
  me
  or he grabbed me or he did this
  or that but it's very often
  a case of something more serious
  but because of the thing that we talked
  about couple of episodes
  ago with the internalized shame
  about these kinds of situations
  it's very hard especially for someone
  who
  she i heard the recordings from the
  police interview and from the start of
  the
  first trial and stuff like that her
  english
  isn't that good so i think it might be
  even harder for her to make an accurate
  statement about what has happened
  partly because she was abused for so
  many years before this happened
  but also because she might
  not have understood all of the questions
  or chosen the right words
  so he was acquitted as we already said
  he went on this grand tour of
  being a dick essentially he was on
  like talk shows where his brother said
  that they went looking for lorena after
  this happened
  with the attempt to kill her he also
  went on howard stern's
  like christmas show where
  howard stern raised money for him
  because he had gotten his dick chopped
  off and like it was done in such a
  horrible way there was like a lot of
  naked women in this christmas show and
  it was like
  oh yeah i don't believe your
  ex-wife because she
  wasn't that pretty i don't believe her
  rape allegations because she had pimples
  howard stern said that i was like
  what in the hell is going on
  why isn't this man not allowed to be
  on media anymore because he still is
  in the media and after john's
  grand tour of america
  the second trial started and because
  there wasn't
  a limitation of the five days
  around the incident they could present
  evidence of past abuse
  so not only did they have evidence
  in the way that they had numerous police
  reports
  there was numerous times where police
  had been
  to their apartment because of domestic
  abuse
  there was also recorded history of her
  injuries and a woman who went to
  lorena's place of work during these five
  days
  before the accident or the mutilation or
  amputation or whatever you want to call
  it
  she had seen lauren on tv
  after the first trial and realized
  that oh shit i could have been
  a witness so she called the
  prosecutor that was handling the first
  kiss
  and was like i didn't know this was
  happening
  i'm a very busy like she had small
  children and stuff she was like i didn't
  know
  but i was one of her clients at the nail
  salon
  lorena worked at a nail salon
  and she told me what was going on
  because
  she had come in for her appointment
  lorena had rolled up her sleeves to do
  the dale
  thing i've never no thing
  yeah i've never been to a nelson
  does it show and she had like
  these horrible bruises all on her
  forearms
  and the client had like gasped
  and lorena had quickly like rolled them
  down again
  and the client had asked where did you
  get those bruises
  and lorena has said my husband
  hurts me so the client had tried to help
  and be like oh
  there's this number you can call there's
  this shelter you can go to
  you could go home with me and she asked
  do you have anywhere to go
  and laurena said no and she was like you
  can come home with me if you want and
  stay at mine
  and lorena had said i can't
  because he told me that if i leave him
  he will kill me and he will also kill
  you
  for protecting me and she had said like
  oh well how do you know
  like and she had said no i have tried to
  leave before
  he has found me before and the abuse
  just kept
  getting worse because he would punish
  her for living
  so she had been like distraught she had
  been crying
  shaking extremely like emotional
  and this is not very uncommon
  the abuse victim sometimes hides abuse
  from their friends and family
  because they're embarrassed about the
  situation
  and they have said like oh no he's not
  gonna do that again he promised me he
  won't do that again
  but they will open up to someone who has
  no connection
  that's not uncommon at all they also
  had evidence of him being
  he had like signed a statement he had
  pled guilty to abuse
  of lorena in the past and in the
  interviews that they did with him in the
  documentary he was like i am
  so i was super strong i was so strong i
  could do
  anything i could run super fast i was
  super strong i was like the strongest
  marine
  i was like john claude van damme
  but i would never ever be
  violent to another person and not only
  has he pled guilty for it and there is
  police reports of it
  and all of that shit has also done it
  afterwards because the pattern of
  abusers is like escalating
  if people can commit violent offenses
  and do like and be so horrible
  to another person it isn't a behavior
  that escalates
  so i think he will kill someone someday
  and she should be in jail
  but that's not what happened do you have
  any forensic
  science evidence about the second trial
  remind me what the second trial is
  against her
  but a lot of violence was about the
  abuse
  so the jury was split
  nine women and three men
  that's the first trial yes ah fuck
  that's okay no i don't have shit on the
  second trial
  that's fine well the first trial is at
  the
  evidence that was presented i kind of
  get
  why it didn't lead anywhere because
  there was so
  much limitations to what the evidence
  could be
  well in in the first trial i found
  quite an interesting quote in that and
  the jury
  agreed with the defense lawyer
  in that the evidence was too
  circumstantial
  and a direct quote from
  the jury was if someone had heard her
  scream
  or if there had been some sort of
  bruising
  that would have made more substantive
  evidence
  and that stuck with me because that kind
  of made my skin
  boil in the they're not looking
  at any kind of character witness
  or previous history
  or anything like that they're just
  looking for
  physical evidence at the time that this
  happened
  and i don't feel like that's how
  prosecutions
  should work particularly for
  sexual abuse trials yeah it did feel
  very disappointing
  because it kind of felt a little bit
  like they didn't do their job
  but i also understand that they were so
  limited
  within the five days they could have
  talked to the neighbor for example
  because
  as we all know or a lot of us know that
  the most dangerous time of leaving
  an abusive partner is one either when
  you're pregnant
  or two when you're leaving your partner
  or the six months after leaving your
  partner
  and lorena had moved her stuff
  in to her neighbor
  because she was leaving john bobbitt
  and he had all this shit talk about uh
  she only got mad because i said that i
  wanted a divorce
  and stuff like that that's his
  explanation
  of what happened but the fact was that
  she was leaving him
  and he had become increasingly
  aggressive
  like saying that i'm gonna shove you
  over the balcony railing
  and tell everyone that you jumped you're
  never gonna
  be able to move on from me because i own
  you
  blah blah blah and the neighbor
  lady that had lorena stuff in her
  apartment
  that happened the day before or two days
  before
  and as lorena describes it
  john bobe and his friend comes back
  shit-faced from the club or pub or
  whatever it's called
  in the americas and john bobet had
  raped her and then she had gone into the
  kitchen
  opened the fridge door the fridge light
  had illuminated the knife on the counter
  she had taken the knife and then she
  doesn't remember anything as she
  said it until she's sitting in her car
  and i'm not sure if that's true or not
  but it
  is also a pretty common response to a
  traumatic
  incident like that there must have been
  a lot of blood
  stuff like that i don't think she her
  brain
  wouldn't let her believe it kind of
  but she knew that she had chopped his
  dick off because
  in the car she had the knife in the one
  hand
  and the dick in the other so she was
  like
  well this must have been what happened
  she didn't have the knife in the car she
  had the dick in the car
  she had the knife in the car she stopped
  at uh
  she she threw the knife in in the bin
  yeah at a 7-eleven no
  she threw the dick at the 7-eleven
  pretty sure
  she threw the knife in a bin at the
  7-eleven
  because there was a forensic scientist
  expert
  that described going to the 7-eleven
  and retrieving it from the bin right
  i might be wrong but i have an image of
  it because she took
  images of it the forensic science person
  and you've just been googling dicks
  no that's what you do with your spare
  time you have to wait until you go to
  the third page of google before pictures
  of trump stopped appearing
  and john bobbitt the absolute
  asshat he also
  spewed a lot of lies about like she just
  wanted to use me
  she just said this because she i was
  leaving her blah blah blah
  i think it's interesting that you
  mention
  the lies because what i found
  intriguing about the trial
  was that the jury somewhat
  decided to follow his story
  yet his story changed three times
  in the legal proceedings so the first
  time
  he said that he came back and
  lorena tried to initiate sex but he was
  too tired
  so he turned her down and he went to
  sleep
  and the next thing he knew his dick
  would been cut off then
  he changed his story to they might have
  had sex but he was quite tired so he
  can't be a hundred percent sure
  and then he had half a dick and then he
  changed his story again
  to say that it was quite a regular
  occurrence
  for him to have sex with her but when he
  was asleep
  so that might have happened and they
  actually had a police officer
  testify and i quote
  if he had sex with his wife
  then he may have done it while he was
  asleep
  and that's an officer of the law
  defending a rape allegation
  by saying he can have
  sexual intercourse with his wife
  while he is asleep yeah i just don't
  understand that at all
  no it's crazy and he also lied
  consistently through the trial
  about saying that he was just dead tired
  he was so
  tired blah blah blah but the
  police or the medical staff
  calling the police about getting the
  dick back so that they could reattach it
  said that he was extremely
  intoxicated and yes their whole defense
  was that john bobe was so
  simple-minded that he could not
  tell lies that was their whole defense
  i was like this is incredibly
  shit like this makes no sense whatsoever
  after that she was acquitted by
  reason of temporary insanity
  or a mental state that could not
  allow her to resist her impulses
  and they compared this to ptsd
  and said that it's a form of ptsd
  because of
  the constant abuse the rapes
  and also the fact that it was escalating
  the threat
  to her life was escalating because she
  was leaving him
  funny enough the last episode of the
  documentary series
  filmed him being in his car and on his
  motorcycle
  and stuff and he had custom-made
  license plates for both his car and his
  motorcycle
  on his motorcycle said trump on his car
  it said dj trump and i was like good
  lord
  i think they waited to show those images
  because they wanted to like show
  everything else first
  which was very good cinematic
  storytelling
  but a thing as well is that as i said
  he was or he was prosecuted and
  convicted for
  sexual abuse and battery and stuff like
  that
  afterwards towards other women he also
  did like
  poor movies and shit like that yeah
  you'll be glad to know listeners that
  his dick
  recovered full functional capabilities
  which i feel like is so unfortunate
  yes i feel like oh it's such a shame
  why couldn't that happen to the tree
  surgeon
  rather than the dick wielding rapist
  yeah i can't really hear you right now
  that's probably because my double chin
  ate my microphone
  [Laughter]
  maybe so thing is that his behavior was
  escalating he also tied
  one of his girlfriends to a bed
  and tortured and raped her for three
  days
  until she played dead where he
  proceeded to wrap her in a sheet and
  untied his her from the bed so that he
  could
  hide the body but when he opened the
  when he unlocked the door she ran for
  her life
  and fortunately she didn't die but that
  just goes to show that
  he will murder someone someday yeah he
  was also
  charged with a lot of battery cases and
  violent offenses after
  his relationship with lorena yeah and
  also as he would say
  i would have never been violent towards
  another person
  in my life said the marine who was
  literally deployed to kill people
  yeah after this and still
  to this day he keeps sending letters
  and messages to lorena's workplaces
  and he has gotten a hold of her
  personal information so he keeps
  stalking her to this day and
  she said in the documentary series which
  was very funny she was like
  i cut his dick off why won't he leave me
  alone
  i thought that was quite funny lorena
  went on with her life
  to be a victims advocate and she
  does a lot of work for domestic abuse
  victims
  do you have anything more to say about
  it
  [Music]
  no no no
  i don't understand how
  he got off but i think it's because of
  the
  the legal wording of rape
  it's so crazy after that
  a lot of victim of domestic abuse
  advocates have like tried to
  get this the urgency of
  legislation that will not allow
  people like him to get off yeah it was
  the same in the uk
  um i think it was in the the early 90s
  that it wasn't actually possible
  to prosecute a husband
  for raping his wife because the law
  and wording of the law was so old that
  the wife was still deemed property of
  the husband
  and it wasn't until i think either the
  80s or the 90s that they changed it
  so that it was actually possible to
  prosecute
  for rape within a marriage so i can
  imagine that
  southern states in the us were still
  behind
  in that regard yeah and also
  like he did serve a prison sentence at
  once for one of the cases where he had
  assaulted one of his girlfriends but it
  was like
  15 months i was like that's
  nothing it's crazy
  um i would also like to say
  before we say goodbye that if you
  or someone you know is a victim of
  domestic abuse
  the phone number for the victim abuse
  hotline in england
  is zero two zero seven nine
  two two seven eight nine one
  i did say all of the numbers correctly
  yay
  [Laughter]
  every time someone asked me about my
  number i'm like
  oh shit oh no oh there's a
  there's a set
  [Music]
  don't worry about it i also need to look
  up
  my own phone number in my contact book
  it's a struggle
  i feel like relative to the struggles
  we've been mentioning in this podcast
  you uh you don't have the worst of lives
  i can't remember my phone number oh what
  was me
  tell that to my itchy butthole
  i'm just kidding did you walk walk only
  before we did the recording uh yeah
  yeah four times today yeah oh good lord
  maybe he is an itchy butthole as well
  no he only pooped twice hmm but
  woke up from a nightmare in her box
  today
  in half i'm not safe in my castle
  and then she threw up in the hallway
  okay that's cute okay let's hope
  to god that this is recording this time
  because i definitely saw a little red
  recording sign at the beginning so
  unless you've
  pressed stop record we should be okay
  this is the second time we're recording
  we're skipping
  this week
  true story i was
  bound to happen sooner or later
  can't trust technology to immigrants
  [Laughter]
  i might apply for a permanent
  settlement citizenship thing
  yeah i've lived here for five years now
  i am allowed to actually have to do a
  test
  like they do in the us is it math or
  mess if they checked my
  browser history they would never let me
  stay in this country
  more like on a scale of one to ten
  how racist was winston churchill
  and then question 1b explain your
  reasoning
  just remember winston churchill is
  very highly regarded in a conservative
  government
  and so if you rate him too highly as a
  racist
  your application for permanent residence
  will be declined
  gosh darn it i have to go back to the
  tundra
  the the only acceptable scoring is
  between
  three and five dig a little hole in the
  snow
  scurry up boodle comes in has a
  nightmare
  throws up in the corner of the igloo
  kick sand back at you because she pooped
  in the entrance
  oh yeah and by sand i mean snow that
  definitely would have been more funny if
  i'd got that right the first time
  [Laughter]
  and if you're listening john bobbitt i
  hope your dick falls off
  and if you're listening james potter
  alohomora
  [Laughter]
  funny because we got an email from a
  james potter
  i know i was there yeah but it's
  delicious
  we tell them our lives
  tmi definitely tgif
  wtf omfg yo
  [Laughter]
  i had to look up where to put the
  periods
  in eg today for our placeholder text in
  our form
  i'm very happy with the form you're
  welcome they come after the abbreviated
  letter
  yeah but i wasn't sure if it was a
  another period after
  the g or if it was just one period
  between the e and the g
  it comes after the g2 because that's
  also abbreviated
  of course i knew that
  the whole time it just
  fills me with confidence that does i was
  just testing you
  for your permanent settlement
  in german etc translates as
  unsolved etc
  is usw oh yeah
  i have a funny language trivia nicholas
  is it about moose more like moose
  knuckle
  no she means vagina
  [Laughter]
  nicholas
  reading the news and then it said
  there was a norwegian news article below
  the swedish news
  article and turns out bomb threat
  is called bombay trocel in norwegian
  is the least threatening word i could
  ever imagine
  it sounds like someone like oh
  i had a little bomb but through sun this
  morning
  i can add that to your norwegian
  dictionary of
  depression and other
  terrible things that they just make
  sound like
  sunny afflictions that will just
  skip away in the future how do you want
  to know

  dirt bag oh sure did it sick
  um that's not as fun sorry okay
  sorry you should have put it in the
  contract
