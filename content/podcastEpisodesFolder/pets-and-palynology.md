#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

I have a mildly amusing too.

Oh yeah? Tell me. 

I was watching Not Going Out, it's the sitcom with Lee Mack in it, and this episode was all about a pub quiz. And one of the questions on the pub quiz was: "pi, the mathematical number, is 3.14. But what is the next number in the sequence?". And one of the characters was like: "what kind of insufferable know-it-all knows anything more than 3.14?", and I was like: "3.1416". Me, I'm that kind of insufferable know-it-all.

I am a bit surprised, but I'm also not surprised. Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

I'm a little bit insulted. \[Laughter]

Well it is funny, because you make fun of know-it-alls sometimes. Or, you do it sarcastically, but I know deep inside you do want to actually correct me.

Nooooo.

You do that unsarcastically sometimes as well.

It's not deep inside at all, it's just brimming beneath the surface. \[Laughter]

Fair enough, fair enough.

\[Music]

Should we start maybe? Okay.

Okay. Let's kick this in the dick! Good evening cocksuckers! \[Laughter]

I might keep that in. Maybe I shouldn't, but I don't care anymore. It's Wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. I'm your host... No! You're listening to Midweek... Fucking shit. Kick it in the dick! \[Laughter]

You have one job. 

I have all the jobs! \[Laughter]

That's the joke dot jpeg.

You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra.

And I'm your host Joe. 

Ba bam!

Kaplow.

I got my information from wikipedia, four separate BBC articles which will be on the blog. On the website. Midweek... Midweek Murders. 

Midweek Murders! \[Mimics Swedish chef]

Midweekmurders.netlify.app. A blog post on crime and investigation, an article in Yorkshire Evening Post... Yorkshire? 

"Yorkshire".

An article in Yorkshire Evening Post by David Bruce, and an article in The Guardian by Martin Wainwright.

Also one of my sources is the BBC News article, also the wiki wiki wah. The national archives which documents her majesty's courts records, a journal article titled "hair as a source of forensic evidence in murder investigations". And what when how dot com, that reminded me all that I'd forgotten about plastic bag striations.

So this week we're going to talk about the murder of Leanne Tiernan. And Leanne Tiernan was a happy, chocolate loving 16 year old, which one of those apply to you. 

You're right. I am a 16 year old. \[Laughter]

I was thinking about chocolate loving. 

I know, that was the joke. 

And Leanne Tiernan was christmas shopping in Leeds city center with her best friend Sarah on the 26th of November in the year 2000. "In the year 2000". That was a Conan O'Brien sketch, you're welcome.

And that is why there was no canned laughter afterwards.

They had taken a bus back to the suburb of Bramley, where they lived, at approximately 4.30 p.m. Leanne and Sarah had begun to walk home together, but parted ways at Houghley Lane where Sarah watched her friend walk towards the wooded area of Houghley Gill. When Sarah had returned home she phoned Leanne's house on the landline, and was told that Leanne wasn't home yet. You remember when we had landlines?

James asked me the other day if I ever call Munich on the land line. I was like: "James, what's a landline?". \[Laughter] I quite like the idea of a landline, but I know that if I installed one it would only ever be telemarketers. Or my mum, who would just call me on my mobile if I ignored the landline anyway.

That's moms for you. Leanne's mother tried calling her cell phone at 5.20 pm, but nobody answered. She tried calling again, but this time the call dropped after just four rings. At 7pm Leanne's mother called the police to report her daughter missing. The search for Leanne started immediately, but the area of Houghley Gill consisted of extremely varied terrain, which made the search very difficult. The police inquest headed by detective superintendent Cris Gregg, not the Gregg pasties person...

Nah that was weak, move on. 

Yeah it was, it was. I don't even know where I was supposed to be going with that, but all right. Calculated her probable route with the help of Sarah, who was the last person to have seen Leanne on the 26th. They went door-to-door along this route, searching 955 houses and countless other buildings, for any clue as where Leanne could be.

I've got some actual numbers on the "countless other things", just to put into context the size of this search.

Okay, yeah. 

1400 houses were questioned. 

Oh god.

800 sheds or garages were searched. 150 commercial properties were searched, so shops and stuff like that. 12 search warrants were issued, and I don't know if you know, but a search warrant needs to be authorized by a judge. Which means that the police officers need an evidence base to be able to get a search warrant approved. So they take time, and they take money, and they take effort, and they got 12 of them. Usually it's hard enough to get one. 140 male DNA samples were taken. A three mile section of a canal was searched, including two of those three miles where the canal was drained to one meter of water. So the search was absolutely massive.

I also wrote down that they searched 32 drain shafts. 

Yeah, and they got help from lots of different organizations to locate hidden drains, and old drains that aren't in service anymore. They really did quite a thorough job.

Yeah. On the 4th of December, police released a facial composite of a man that had been spotted walking his dog in the Houghley Gill area at the time of leanne's disappearance. And I actually looked up the composite, and it is quite similar to the man that was responsible for Leanne's disappearance and death. I looked into this a little bit more, and he was actually spotted in the area like an hour before Leanne went missing. I'm a bit surprised that somebody saw him, and I'm also a bit surprised that they could remember, kind of, what the face looked like. It was quite interesting actually, and also goes to show that they did talk to so many people that they were like: "this man, an hour before Leanne went missing, might be a person of interest". But I also remembered like, you know... Do you remember the dodgy dog walker episode? 

No. \[Laughter]

We talked about like, this one guy who... Police interest peaked about him, because he was out walking his dog, but he had nothing to do with the actual case. But this time it actually did have something to do with the case. 

I always find it suspicious that it's a dog walker that finds someone, or a cadaver, at six o'clock in the morning. What kind of maniac goes out at six o'clock in the morning to walk their dog? Obviously a murderer. \[Laughter]

Ollie would like that, but that's not the case for you. 

He wouldn't. He complains if I have to take him out too early.

Aww, that's why he's so perfect for you, because he's so old. 

Yeah. Screw getting a puppy. Ugh, could you imagine? \[Laughter]

No, I couldn't imagine, because puppies are a lot of work.

I mean it's bad enough anyway, I have to take him out four times a day. But when he gets the shits and it's at three o'clock in the morning?

Yeah. 

I ain't invested in that life. This dog-owning business has just reaffirmed for me the fact that I do not want children.

Well, you chose to have a dog.

I know, and he's great company for about 10 minutes every day and then he slinks off and does his own thing, which is great. But a baby won't slink off and do their own thing, you have to pay attention to them all the time. I'm like: "why aren't you grown up and have left the house already?".

To all the listeners out there, if this makes it into the cut, I don't think you've been invested in anything as you're invested in your dog. So don't be worried, the dog lives a great life.

He is my only reason for existence. 

Oh yeah. Nine months after Leanne was last seen, another dog walker, this is the one you were talking about...

Surprise surprise.

...named Mark Bisson was out for a walk with his puppers in Lindley woods North Yorkshire, 16 miles from Leanne's home. He came across Leanne's body only 100 yards away from where another murder victim, a woman named Yvonne Fitt, had been found in 1992. So 100 yards is?

I'm going to guess 108 meters.

91.4 meters.

Ah! I wen't the wrong way.

Yeah. So almost there, almost. Leanne's body was identified by her fingerprints. And now I wrote: "autopsy and things found with the body". Maybe that's your... \[Laughter] What was found with Leanne's body?

A lot, forensically. So we can start with the fingerprints. So they identified her body by fingerprints, but obviously she... I say obviously. Most likely, she wasn't on the fingerprint database. So they would have taken comparison prints of objects in her house that she likely would have touched. 

Okay. I have a question about that.

Si. 

I think I saw Captain Marvel recently, again. 

Oh here we go, I'm expecting this to be highly reliable.

And Nick Fury lifted a fingerprint with a piece of tape from his, like, ID card. Because somebody else touched it. But I've always been believing, because of movies again, that you have to like warm it up or something? 

So it depends on what surface the fingerprint is on, which will determine which technique that you need to use. But most of the time if it's a solid surface; a desk, a pen, an ID card... Anything that's not like a carrier bag or something, you need to use a different technique for a carrier bag. But anything that's a non-malleable surface, all you need to do to recover the fingerprint is dust it with a specific powder, and then literally lift it with a bit of clear tape. 

Okay, so you have to dust it first?

Yes. You won't be able to recover a fingerprint unless the fingerprint is left in dust already. So unless your fingerprint is on a surface that you can visually see the fingerprint. So for example, one of the best case scenarios for a scene of crime officer is a carjacking where the car is a manual transmission and has a chrome, or metallic, gearbox. Because you'll have extra sweat, because of the adrenaline, and the metal is non-absorbent. So you can get perfect fingerprints from a metal gear box, just from the sweat. I think that they would dust it anyway, but you can visually see that fingerprint already, so you know it's there. 

So you can't actually lift the fingerprint with tape unless you can already see it? 

Yes. 

Okay. 

So that's why a lot of things like CSI Miami, or any kind of tv show that feature forensic science, they're always running around with like a little tiny feather duster. And that's essentially what they use to administer the fingerprint dust onto surfaces. So you dust down the surface and then that will show up the fingerprint, and then you just lay a bit of tape over it carefully, peel that off and then lay it down on some clear acetone.

He also folded his tape with the fingerprint on it, and then went to use it again. I'm like: "that wouldn't work", right? 

If you close the tape over the fingerprint and then reopen to use the tape again, you won't be able to use that fingerprint. 

No. That's what I thought as well. I was like: "this doesn't make sense".

So yeah, that would be the fingerprint, we've covered that, we can tick that. Lovely. Good job. They also got a cryo biological expert, I don't know what the full word is, I just wrote cryobio because it's fun. Might be cryobiology, might be biological whatever.

I don't actually know what that is. 

I'm talking about it! If you'd give me a minute! \[Laughter]

Fine, fine.

I mean to be fair, I would expect you to know what this is because it has greek stems. Let's do the easy ones: what's "ology"?

I did this in Swedish, so fuck you. But..

Okay. So what's "ology"? \[Mimics Swedish chef] 

It's the "study of". I was going to say the "learning of", but that's incorrect.

Well yeah, that's the same thing innit. Then "bio".

Bio is life. 

Yeah, living things innit. So, so far we've got "the study of living things". And then "cryo".

No. Wait. 

You'll kick yourself, because I know it's in there.

Yeah. Yeah well, I wasn't expecting a pop quiz okay?!

Well, we need to mix these up a bit. Murder, murder, murder. That's all you talk about. \[Laughter] Cryo is freezing, or frozen.

Yeah, of course... Fucking hell. I was going to say that! 

See, I knew it was in there, I knew it!

And then I was like: "no that's silly, you're thinking of Star Wars".

So cryo chambers are like the futuristic: "you freeze your body, and then thaw it in the future". Supposedly what happened to Walt Disney, not true. So yeah, a cryobiologist is the expert that looks at the study of frozen life, whether that be plant-based or animal based. So they brought one of these people in, and they looked at the decomposition of Leanne's body and the stage that she should have been in given that it was eight months, I think, between her disappearance and her body being found.

Yeah, nine months. 

Okay. So you'd expect her to be in an advanced state of decay. What they found was, she was not. 

I kind of guessed, because of the fingerprint.

Yeah. They likely wouldn't have been able to recover any soft tissue evidence over that amount of time. 

Yeah. 

They'd have to look at teeth, or hair, or something like that to be able to identify her. So what this told the investigators was that she had recently been placed in that shallow grave, and that she hadn't been there the whole time. Which is why, when they did that massive search of that massive area, nothing came up. Because she literally was not there. Her body was in, I think, nine bin bags. Might be a different number, but I feel like it's nine.

Oh god.

Not chopped up, for once. And also a floral patterned duvet, the floral pattern seems to be significant to a lot of the people that have written these reports. I can find no significance to it, but they all mentioned it, so I thought I'd let you know as well. She had a dog collar, a leather dog collar, that was closing one of the bags over her head.

Okay. So it was on top of the bag? 

Yeah. So the bag was on her, and then the dog collar was sealing that bag around her neck. She was also bound, with her arms behind her back, with cable ties. One of the bags that was used to cover her body was a specific type of green plastic bag. I don't know if it was a bag, but it was definitely a green plastic. And she also had a scarf that was knotted around her neck. 

Okay. 

That's the summary of the condition that they found her body in.

Yeah. So after Leanne had been identified, the police made a public appeal asking for any information about people living in Bramley who had a connection to Lindley woods where the body had been found. After this appeal, two separate women reached out to police about a man named John Taylor. They were both former girlfriends of his, and told police that they had driven past Lindley woods with John, who had told them that he would go there regularly to poach. The police were also tracking another lead, they had contacted over 100 pet stores in an effort to identify the person who had purchased the dog collar that was around the plastic bag. This had been ultimately successful, as one company was able to supply the police with the name of a customer who had bought several of these dog collars, and who lived in Bramley. 

Sorry, I just want to interject. Because I found particular aspects of the police work behind finding and linking the evidence really fascinating. Which is probably just a reflection of my sad, sad personality. But for the dog collar, they worked out that it was made by one specific company in Nottinghamshire.

Okay. 

They then followed that, so they got in contact with that company and they said: "yep, we sent this particular brand of collar to 112 wholesalers". So they then got in contact with all of those 112 individual wholesalers and said: "has anybody, in this time frame, purchased one of these collars?". And so they got a list of people back with addresses, and whatever else data the police can seize. And one sale in Liverpool, they found that Taylor was the customer.

I think it was a mail order? 

Yeah. So he bought it online, which probably made it easier to track him, because they had shipping addresses. So they would have said to the wholesalers: "okay, did you ship to anybody in this area during these dates?". And so they got the list and they cross referenced it. But I just find it so incredible, that from a random looking leather dog collar they can come up with a positive ID for someone who's already a suspect.

Yeah. And also, in Liverpool. Which, I'm guessing, is not North Yorkshire or whatever?

It's not, no. That's why it's called Liverpool. \[Laughter] Yeah, I just thought it was a particularly interesting point. 

Yeah. It is crazy. So John Taylor, a 44 year old dick bag and Parcelforce employee, lived less than a mile from Leanne. Known locally as the "pet man" which, a weird moniker but alrighty then. He owned several animals such as ferrets, ew, and dogs.

You're just thinking of Draco as a ferret.

Ferrets might be good pets, I don't know. Being a Parcelforce employee would have given him access to the cable ties found with Leanne's body, as these were more or less only supplied to Royal Mail, Parcelforce's parent company. Which is funny, because we mentioned Royal Mail in the last episode. We shit on them, but it's good that they exist.

They're back! \[Laughter]

They're back. Okay. Maybe we should talk about the evidence that linked John Taylor to Leanne's body?

You've already done two of it, so my role here is reduced. They also found a dog hair on Leanne's person, I don't know where they found it exactly. Did you read that at all?

No, I thought it was a human hair?

They found a human hair, but they also found a dog hair. 

Oh, okay. 

So they sent this dog hair to a university in Texas. Yeah, long way to go. Which specialized in DNA profiling for pedigree dog research. So you could submit your dog's hair to them, and they'd be like: "nah, that's a mongrel, not a pedigree. Don't spend seven thousand dollars on it".

Didn't know that was a thing, but good to know. 

So they managed to get a partial profile from the hair that was recovered, and they believe that it would have been a match to the dog that Taylor owned, which conveniently died of heart failure just as the police were starting to close in on Taylor. 

Oh. I thought that he killed the dog.

That was why I said it laced with sarcasm. \[Laughter]

Sorry.

Yeah. So a lot of people think that he killed the dog and burnt the body, so that he couldn't be linked back to Leanne's murder. Yeah, like you said, they also found a human hair. This was found on the scarf that was wrapped around her neck, and it was in the knot. So they were pretty sure that this was not a cross-contamination, that it had come from either Leanne or the main suspect. 

Yeah. 

They easily ruled out Leanne, because she still had her hair, easy cross reference. Done. They couldn't recover enough DNA to be able to use nuclear DNA. So nuclear DNA is all in the root of your hair. So if you pluck a hair out, the only way that it can be matched by nuclear DNA is if it's still got its root attached. There wasn't enough DNA on the hair to be able to use nuclear DNA, so they used a relatively newer technique which is mitochondrial DNA. So the important thing to remember about mitochondrial DNA is - it is not unique to each person like your nuclear DNA is. So because your nuclear DNA is a mix of both of your parents, and then a certain combination of that which makes it different to your siblings. Your siblings, if you have any, will have exactly the same mitochondrial DNA as you. So you can't use it to identify, uniquely, a person. But you can use it to identify someone of that maternal lineage. So if Taylor had a brother, you wouldn't have been able to tell which one of the two of them the hair belonged to, but you would be able to determine that it was one of those two. 

Yeah. 

Or a sister. 

Yeah.

So there's a bit more evidence. So like we mentioned before, there was a green plastic that was found that was used to wrap the body. The sample that was recovered from the body was found to be a match to some green plastic that Taylor had in his home. He'd used some twine to tie up some of the bags, this was linked back to a specific brand of twine that was manufactured in Devon, that was usually only sold to the ministry of defense. Now that company said: "actually, we did make an individual batch, that was a one-off, that we gave to retailers to use in rabbit hunting", which is one of the things that a certain Mr Taylor was particularly fond of. They managed to link the twine that was found on the body to the twine that was found in his house, and link it back to that specific one manufacturer to be able to connect the dots. So pretty impressive stuff there as well.

Yeah crazy.

You think that it's crazy, but to be fair, both fiber ID, so the twine, and plastic ID can be done just by microscopy.

This is a weird question, maybe. But this can't be ruled as circumstantial, right? 

No. 

No. 

It's a direct link between the body and a source material found in his home. Like if they hadn't found a batch of cable ties in his bedside drawer, that were the exact same manufacturer as the ones used by the Royal Mail, then the cable ties would have been circumstantial. Because the cable ties found at the body would have been linked back to the ones supplied by the royal mail

and he worked for the royal mail yeah

but because they were also found in his

bedside table

that then moves beyond the realm of

circumstantial

to hard evidence you've got a batch of

these cable ties

they have been used on this body must

have been you

and because it wasn't a cable tie

readily available to the to the general

public

yeah okay the same as the twine so if it

were just a

generic white string that he'd bought

from tesco

for example other retailers are

available it would have been

circumstantial evidence because you

can't link

that twine to the twine that was used on

the body

but because it was specifically made by

one company

that sold it to a specific batch of

retailers

and then they looked at the microscopy

and found that the twist direction was

the same the blend of fibers were the

same

any dye or manufacturing defects were

the same

it then moves beyond the realm of

circumstantial to being hard evidence

circumstantial evidence is enough to be

able to give you a hint

you wouldn't be able to as a jury member

say beyond reasonable doubt that this

piece of evidence

links this person to this crime when you

add them all together

which has been the case in previous

cases if you add a bunch of

circumstantial evidence

together then it's beyond reasonable

doubt

yeah then that all accumulates to become

beyond reasonable doubt but if you've

only got

a couple of bits then you can't really

prosecute on it

yeah well they do in america for example

but we have a much better legal system

than them

i would hope so yes okay were you going

to say something else because i was

going to talk about the pollen that was

\[ __ ] amazing i'm excited about the

pollen

actually ah mate the pollen

so i genuinely was so

fascinated reading this paper because i

was not taught anything

about pollen analysis during my course

so writing my notes i've done what

you've done and have blocked

capital written notes just like oh my

god this has blown my mind what has

happened

so for the listeners who are not aware

of the full details of the case

they brought in a pollen analyst

to look over any pollen

or biological detritus such as leaves

twigs

etc that were found on the body and to

be able

to narrow down where liane had been

previously whether she was kept in the

forest the whole time

which they sort of knew she hadn't

because of the cryobiology

but just wanted to be sure i think

that's probably

why they were able to and also

did all of the analysis of the body

because she still had soft tissue

it's much much easier to get the

approval

and financial backing to be able to do

all of these kind of

wacky out there tests when you've got

some kind of evidential basis to go by

yeah they probably wouldn't have even

bothered looking at the pollen

if she was in a nine-month state of

decay

that they would expect to see yeah so

they took

samples from her hair she had

some charcoal-like deposits

and other stuff in her hair

other stuff it took

swabs of her nasal cavity and

found some evidence on the bed covering

the aforementioned

floral that covering that she was

covered in

yeah so from these sample profiles

they managed to determine a bunch of

different plant varieties that were

non-native to the environment that she

was found in

so she was found in woodland and they

found

pollen or physical samples of

a privet hedge elder trees bramble

bushes

hawthorne trees a cherry or plum

or slow bush and buckler fern

so those are all like plants or bushes

they also

found pollen from beech and

poplar trees and the pollen profiles

were dominated by nettle pollen

and a thing called orachi or

orange if there's any plant people out

there

i apologize for butchering the

pronunciation of

whatever that word is the most

interesting thing for me

is that they looked at these pollen

profiles that they'd got from the body

and they came up with a scenario

or a place that was almost an exact

match for taylor's back garden so they

were like

judging by the amount of x y and z

it's probably in a garden that's got

an overgrown privet hedge that's

got overgrown nettles so it's not going

to be a well

manicured garden there will be fire pits

like you're just burning \[ __ ] in your

garden is that why they found the

charcoal

on her hair yeah because of the fire pit

oh

yeah and the thing that blew my mind

that was in block capitals

the beach and poplar pollen from the

trees

yeah they managed to say that these

two species of trees would

just be visible where the body was

oh my god they were like we found some

pollen

from a beech tree but it was only a

little bit and so

therefore a couple of gardens across

somewhere will have a beach tree growing

that is \[ __ ] crazy and mental

so once all of the other evidence had

linked

taylor to the crime they went to his

house

obviously went into his back garden and

test to your memory

his garden was overrun by a privet hedge

had a \[ __ ] ton of nettles he had plum

and damson trees there was a poplar

observable in the distance and there was

abundant buckler ferns

that is \[ __ ] crazy they also found

fungal remains so a bit of mushrooms

and charcoal remnants that under

microscopy were the same species

so the fungi were the same species that

were recovered on the body

as to the ones that were found in his

garden

the charcoal was an exact match so

obviously

wood or coal burns in a specific way

so if you've got a barbecue for instance

and you stick your hand in it that

charcoal will be unique to

coming from that barbecue that's so

crazy though

it gets even crazier they were like

there's quite

significantly large portions

of charcoal or burnt fragments that they

recovered in her hair

from which they were able to determine

almost

the exact positioning of her body

while he burnt \[ __ ] in his garden what

the \[ __ ]

i can theoretically understand this

but also i'm like why isn't this always

done i think it probably comes down to a

dead end

this in this situation is circumstantial

evidence

because it's highly likely that the same

ratio of plant matter would be found

in his next-door neighbor's garden yeah

if they also

left it to be overgrown so unless

there's actually a call

for doing it you're not gonna get any

evidence out of it

so i understand the frustration with

finding a case like this

and they've done absolutely everything

you can think of

and it's come to a nice conclusion in

that this guy's been found and sentenced

but if they didn't have any kind of link

to him

in the first place they wouldn't have

done

the pollen analysis yeah the twine

analysis would have come back

inconclusive they've been like yeah this

is just string

the plastic would have come back as this

is plastic

it's only because they got the

corroborating story

from his ex-girlfriends and then all of

the other evidence

linked itself together yeah that this

became possible to id him in such a way

that they got the positive

it's the problem with a lot of cold

cases is that you can recover

all of the material from the crime scene

so someone who's been sexually assaulted

and then murdered

you can recover a dna profile from any

semen deposit but if you haven't got

anyone in the database that matches it

and that's all the evidence you've got

that's where the case stops yeah because

there's nowhere to go

from that short of testing everybody in

the local area

which they did do in this case and

they've done it in a couple of

historical cases as well

the first dna case springs to mind i

don't

think they can do it anymore yeah but

also

i must command the west yorkshire police

yeah they did a really thorough job yeah

it was incredible which is refreshing

given the amount of cases we've done

where the police have been like

herp derp evidence

yeah it's been appalling in some cases

but yeah i've got one more bit so there

were also

carpet fibers that were recovered

from leanne's body whether it was the

body or a clothing i'm not sure

doesn't really matter they found some

carpet taylor had actually tried to be

clever

and had ripped up all of the carpet in

his house

which i think attributes to burn piles

in his garden it's either his carpet or

his dog

probably both what he wasn't smart

enough to do

was remove all of the carpet so when the

scenes of crimes officers popped into

his house

and looked into the corners of his

living room

he'd actually missed some carpet on some

of the nails that hold the carpet in

place

so like pluck popped that under a

microscope and what do you know

perfect match

wait perfect mask for what for the blood

i know the carpet

the carpet found on her body was the

perfect match

to the remnants of the carpet that was

found in his house so they were like

she was in here brah yeah yeah just do a

little mic

drop because now i've finished the

evidence

i'm out it's all you it was a lot of

\[ __ ] evidence it was crazy

i know right i'm \[ __ ] parched i read

some of it on the like wikipedia page

but that doesn't

really encompass all of the actual

evidence that was there

now you need a bit of me yeah

no i mean it i mean it anyone can

\[ __ ] google a microscope can't they

mate you ain't that special

so only one month after leanne's body

had been

found john taylor was charged

with her murder he pleaded guilty

and at the trial the judge stated that

john was a dangerous sexual sadist

who should expect to spend the rest of

his life

in custody when police added his dna to

their database

he was linked to two rape cases in

1988 and 1989

one of which had occurred on the same

footpath

where leanne had been abducted taylor

was found

guilty of these and received two further

life sentences

because of these rapes okay so

thank you so much for listening to

midweek murders

special thanks to jim and jordan

we appreciate you thank you thank you

bye bye 

Ciao pow!
