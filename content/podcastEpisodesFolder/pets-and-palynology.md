#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

I have a mildly amusing too.

Oh yeah? Tell me. 

I was watching not going

out it's the

sitcom with lee mac in it and this

episode was all about a pub quiz

and one of the questions on the pub quiz

was

pi the mathematical number is 3.14

but what is the next number in the

sequence

and one of the characters was like what

kind of insufferable

know-it-all knows anything more than

3.14

and i was like 3.1416

me i'm that kind of insufferable now at

all

i am a bit surprised but i'm also not

surprised well i shouldn't be surprised

i'm a little bit insulted

well it is funny because

you make fun of know-it-alls sometimes

or you do it sarcastically

but i know deep inside you do want to

actually correct me

no

you do that unsarcastically sometimes as

well

it's not deep inside at all it's just

brimming beneath the surface

fair enough fair enough

should we start maybe okay

okay let's kick this in the dick

good evening \[ __ ]

\[Laughter]

i might keep that in maybe i shouldn't

but i don't

care anymore

it's wednesday which means that it's

time to talk about crime i'm your host

no you're listening to midweek

\[ \_\_ ] \[ \_\_ ] kick it in

you have one job i have

all the jobs

that's the joke dot jpeg

you're listening to midweek murders and

i'm your host sandra

i'm your host joe bye-bye

i got my information from wikipedia

four separate bbc articles which

will be on the blog on the website

midweek

midweek merlin weekend

\[Music]

midweek murders.net life dot app

a blog post on crime and investigation

an article in yorkshire evening

post yorkshire yorkshire

an article in yorkshire evening post by

david bruce and an

article in the guardian by martin wayne

wright

also one of my sources is the bbc news

article also the wiki wiki

the national archives which documents

her majesty's courts records a

journal article titled hair as a source

of forensic evidence in murder

investigations

and what when how dot com

that reminded me all that i'd forgotten

about plastic bag

striations

so this week we're going to talk about

the murder of leanne

tiernon and leanne tiernon was a happy

chocolate loving 16 year old which

one of those applied to you you're right

i am a 16 year old

i was thinking about chocolate flour i

know

that was the joke and leanne tiernon was

christmas

shopping in lids city center with her

best friend

sarah on the 26th of november and the

year

2000. in the year 2000

that was a conan o'brien sketch you're

welcome

and that is why there was no canned

laughter afterwards

they had taken a bus back to the suburb

of

bramley where they lived at

approximately

4 30 p.m leanne and sarah had begun to

walk home together

but parted ways at huffley lynn where

sarah watched her friend

walk towards the wooded area of huffle

jill

when sarah had returned home she phoned

leanne's house

on the landline and was told that leanne

wasn't home yet

you remember when we had landlines

james asked me the other day if i ever

call munich on the land line

that james what's a landline

i quite like the idea of a landline but

i know

that if i installed one it would only

ever be telemarketers

or my mum who would just call me on my

mobile if i ignored the landline anyway

that's moms for you leanne's mother

tried calling her cell phone at 5

20 pm but nobody answered

she tried calling again but this time

the call dropped after just

four rings at 7pm leanne's mother

called the police to report her daughter

missing

the search for leanne started

immediately

but the area of huffle jill consisted of

extremely

varied terrain which made the search

very difficult

the police inquest headed by detective

superintendent chris greg

not the greg pastis person

nah that was weak move on yeah it wasn't

i don't even know where i was supposed

to be going with that but all right

calculated her probable route with the

help of sarah

who was the last person to have seen

leanne on the 26th

they went door-to-door along this route

searching

950 houses and countless

other buildings for any clue as where

leanne could be

i've got some actual numbers on the

countless other things

just to put into context the size of

this search

okay yeah 1 400

houses were questioned oh god

800 sheds or garages were searched

150 commercial properties searched

so shops and stuff like that 12 search

warrants were issued

and i don't know if you know but a

search warrant needs to be

authorized by a judge which means that

the police officers

need an evidence base to be able to get

a search warrant approved

so they take time and they take money

and they take effort

and they got 12 of them usually it's

hard enough to get one

140 male dna samples were taken

a three mile section of a canal was

searched

including two of those three miles where

the canal

was drained to one meter of water

so the search was absolutely massive

i also wrote down that they searched 32

drain shafts yeah and they got help

from lots of different organizations

to locate hidden drains and

old drains that aren't in service

anymore

they really did quite a thorough job

yeah

on the 4th of december police released

a facial composite of a man that had

been spotted

walking his dog in the huffly jill area

at the time of leanne's disappearance

and i actually

looked up the composite and it is

quite similar to the man

that was responsible for leanne's

disappearance

and death i

looked into this a little bit more and

he was

actually spotted in the area like an

hour before leanne went missing i'm a

bit surprised that somebody saw him

and i'm also a bit surprised that they

could remember

kind of what the face looked like it was

quite

interesting actually and also ghosts

showed that they did talk to so many

people

that they were like this man an hour

before leanne

went missing might be a person of

interest but i also remembered like you

know

do you remember the dodgy dog walker

episode no

we talked about like this one guy who

police

interest peaked about him because he was

out walking his dog but he had nothing

to do with the

actual case but this time it actually

did have something to do with the case i

always

find it suspicious that it's a dog

walker that finds someone

or a cadaver at six o'clock in the

morning

what kind of maniac goes out at six

o'clock in the morning to walk the dog

obviously a murderer

ollie would like that but that's not he

wouldn't

he complains if i have to take him out

too early

oh that's why he's so perfect

for you because he's so old yeah screw

getting a puppy

ugh could you imagine

couldn't imagine because puppies are a

lot of work

i mean it's bad enough anyway i have to

take him out four times a day

but when he gets the shits and it's at

three o'clock in the morning

yeah i ain't invested in that life this

dog-owning business has just reaffirmed

for me the fact that i do not want

children

well you chose to have a dog

i know and he's great company for about

10 minutes every day

and then he slinks off and does his own

thing which is great

but a baby won't slink off and do their

own thing you have to pay attention to

them

all the time i'm like why aren't you

grown up and i've left the house already

to all the listeners out there if this

makes it into the cut

i don't think you've been invested in

anything as you're invested

in your dog so don't be worried

the dog lives a great life

he is my only reason for existence oh

yeah nine months after leanne was last

seen another dog walker this is the one

you were talking about

surprise surprise named mark bisson

was out for a stall with his papas

in lindley woods north yorkshire

16 miles from leanne's home

he came across leanne's body only 100

yards

away from where another murder victim a

woman named

yvonne fit had been found in 1992

so 100 yards is i'm going to guess 108

meters

91.4 in the wrong way

yeah so almost there almost leanne's

body was

identified by her fingerprints

and now i wrote autopsy and things found

with the body

maybe that's war

what was found with leon's body

a lot forensically so we can start with

the fingerprints

so they identified her body by

fingerprints but obviously she

i say obviously most likely she wasn't

on the fingerprint database so they

would have taken

comparison prints of objects in her

house

that she likely would have touched okay

i have a question about that

see i think i saw captain marvel

recently again here we go i'm expecting

this to be highly reliable

and nick fury lifted a fingerprint with

a piece of tape

from his like id card

because somebody else touched it but

i've always been

believing because of movies again that

you have to like

warm it up or something so it depends on

what

surface the fingerprint is on

which will determine which technique

that you need to use

but most of the time if it's a solid

surface

a desk a pen an id card anything that's

not like a carrier bag or something you

need to use a different technique for a

carrier bag but anything that's a

non-malleable surface all you need to do

to recover the fingerprint is

dust it with a specific powder and then

literally lift it with a bit of

clear tape okay so you have to dust it

first

yes you won't be able to recover a

fingerprint unless the fingerprint is

left in dust already so unless your

fingerprint is

on a surface that you can visually see

the fingerprint

so for example one of the best case

scenarios for a

scene of crime officer is a

carjacking where the car is a manual

transmission

and has a chrome or metallic gearbox

because you'll have extra sweat because

of the adrenaline

and the metal is non-absorbent

so you can get perfect fingerprints

from a metal gear box just from the

sweat

i think that they would dust it anyway

but you can visually see

that fingerprint already so you know

it's there so you can't actually

lift the fingerprint with tape unless

you can already

see it yes okay so that's why

a lot of things like csi miami

or any kind of tv show that features

forensic science they're always running

around with like a little tiny feather

duster

and that's essentially what they use to

administer the

fingerprint dust onto surfaces so you

dust down the surface and then that will

show up the fingerprint

and then you just lay a bit of tape over

it carefully peel that off and then lay

it down on some clear acetone

he also folded his tape with the

fingerprint on it and then

went to use it again i'm like that

wouldn't work

right if you close the tape over the

fingerprint

and then reopen to use the tape again

you won't be able to use that

fingerprint no that's what i thought as

well i was like this doesn't make sense

so yeah that would be the fingerprint

we've covered that we can tick that

lovely good job they also

got a cryo biological

expert i don't know what the full word

is i just wrote cryobio because it's fun

might be cryobiology might be biological

whatever

i don't actually know what that is i'm

talking about it

you'd give me a minute fine fine

i mean to be fair i would expect you to

know what this is because it has

greek stems let's do the easy ones

what's ology

i did this in swedish so \[ __ ] you but

okay so what's uh

it's the study of i was going to say the

learning of

but that's well yeah that's correct same

thing in it then bio

bio is life yeah

living things in it so so far we've got

the study of living

things and then cryo no

wait you'll kick yourself because i know

it's in there

yeah yeah well i wasn't expecting a pop

quiz okay

well we need to mix these up a bit

murder murder murder that's all you talk

about

cryo is freezing or frozen

\[ __ ] hell see i knew it was in there

i knew it

and then i was like no that's silly

you're thinking of star wars

so cryo chambers are like the futuristic

you freeze your body and then thaw it in

the future supposedly what happened to

walt disney

not true so yeah a cryobiologist is the

expert

that looks at the study of frozen

life whether that be plant-based or

animal based so they brought one of

these people in and

they looked at the decomposition of

leanne's body

and the stage that she should have been

in

given that it was eight months

i think between her disappearance and

her body being found

yeah nine months okay so you'd expect

her to be

in an advanced state of decay

what they found was she was not i kind

of guessed because of the fingerprint

yeah they likely wouldn't have been able

to recover any soft tissue evidence

over that amount of time yeah they'd

have to look at teeth

or hair or something like that to be

able to identify her

so what this told the investigators was

that she had

recently been placed in that shallow

grave and that she hadn't been there

the whole time which is why when they

did that

massive search of that massive area

nothing came up

because she literally was not there

her body was in i think

nine bin bags might be a different

number but i feel like it's nine

not chopped up for once and also

a floral patterned duvet the floral

pattern seems to be significant to a lot

of the people that

have written these reports i can find no

significance to it but they all

mentioned it

so i thought i'd let you know as well

she had

a dog collar a leather dog collar that

was

closing one of the bags over her head

okay so it was on top of the bag yeah so

the bag was on

her and then the dog collar was sealing

that bag

around her neck she was also bound with

her arms behind her back with cable ties

one of the bags that was used to cover

her body was

a specific type of green plastic

bag i don't know if it was a bag but it

was definitely a green

plastic and she also had a scarf that

was

knotted around her neck okay that's the

summary of the condition that they found

her body in

yeah so after lyanna had been identified

the police made a public appeal asking

for any information about people living

in bramley

who had a connection to lindley woods

where

the body had been found after this

appeal

two separate women reached out to police

about a man named john taylor

they were both former girlfriends of his

and told police that they had driven

past lindley woods with john

who had told them that he would go there

regularly

to poach the police were also tracking

another lead

they had contacted over 100

pet stores in an effort to identify the

person who had purchased

the dog collar that was around the

plastic bag

this had been ultimately successful as

one company was able to supply the

police with the name

of a customer who had bought several of

these dog collars

and who lived in bramley sorry

i just want to because

i found particular aspects of the police

work

behind finding and linking the evidence

really fascinating which is probably

just a reflection of my sad sad

personality but for the dog collar

they worked out that it was made by

one specific company in nottinghamshire

okay they then followed that so they got

in contact with that company and they

said yep we sent

this particular brand of collar to 112

wholesalers so they then got in contact

with all of those 112

individual wholesalers and said has

anybody

in this time frame purchased one of

these

collars and so they got a list of people

back with

addresses and whatever else data the

police can seize

and one sale in liverpool

they found that taylor was the customer

i think

it was a mail order yeah so he bought it

online

which probably made it easier to track

him because they had shipping addresses

so they would have said to the

wholesalers okay did you ship to anybody

in this area

during these dates and so they got the

list and they cross referenced it

but i just find it so incredible that

from

a random looking leather dog collar

yeah they can come up with a positive id

for someone who's already a suspect

yeah and also in liverpool

which i'm guessing is not north

yorkshire or whatever

it's not no that's why it's called

liverpool

yeah i just thought it was a

particularly interesting point yeah it

is crazy

so john taylor a 44 year old dick bag

and partial force employee

lived less than a mile from leanne known

locally as the pet man which

a weird moniker but alrighty then

he owns several animals such as ferrets

ew and dogs

he's just thinking of draco as a ferret

ferrets might be good pets i don't know

being a parcel force employee

would have given him access to the cable

ties

found with leanne's body as these were

more or less

only supplied to royal mail

parcel forces parent company which is

funny because we mentioned

royal mail in the last episode we \[ __ ]

on them

but it's good fist

they're back okay maybe we should talk

about

the evidence that linked john taylor to

lia's body

you've already done two with it so

my role here is reduced

they also found a dog hair on

leanne's person i don't know

where they found it exactly did you read

that at all

no i thought it was a human hair

they found a human hair but they also

found a dog hair oh

okay so they sent this dog hair

to a university in texas

yeah long way to go which specialized

in dna profiling for

pedigree dog research so you could

submit your dog's hair to them and

they'd be like nah that's a mongrel not

a pedigree

don't spend seven thousand dollars on it

didn't know that was a thing

but good to know so they managed to get

a partial profile

from the hair that was recovered and

they believe

that it would have been a match to the

dog

that taylor owned which conveniently

died of heart failure just as the police

were starting to close in on taylor oh

i thought that he killed the dog

that was why i said it laced with

sarcasm

sorry

yeah so a lot of people think that he

killed the dog and burnt the body so

that he couldn't be linked back to

leanne's murder

yeah like he said they also found a

human hair

this was found on the scarf that was

wrapped around her neck

and it was in the knot so they were

pretty sure

that this was not a cross-contamination

that it had come from either liane or

the main suspect yeah they easily pulled

out liane

because she still had her hair easy

cross reference

done they couldn't recover enough

dna to be able to use nuclear dna

so nuclear dna is all in the root of

your hair

so if you pluck a hair out the only way

that it can be matched by nuclear dna is

if it's still got its root attached

there wasn't enough dna on the hair to

be able to use

nuclear dna so they used a relatively

newer technique which is

mitochondrial dna so the important

thing to remember about mitochondrial

dna

is it is not unique to each person

like your nuclear dna is so because your

nuclear dna is a

mix of both of your parents and then a

certain combination

of that which makes it different to your

siblings your siblings

if you have any will have exactly the

same mitochondrial dna as you

so you can't use it to identify

uniquely a person but you can use it to

identify

someone of that maternal lineage so if

taylor had a brother you wouldn't have

been able to tell which one of the two

of them the hair belonged to but you

would be able to determine that it was

one of those two yeah or a sister yeah

so there's a bit more evidence

so like we mentioned before there was a

green plastic that was found that was

used to wrap the body

the sample that was recovered from the

body

was found to be a match to some green

plastic that taylor had in his home

he'd used some twine to tie up some of

the bags

this was linked back to a specific

brand of twine that was manufactured

in devon that was usually

only sold to the ministry of defense

now that company said actually

we did make an individual batch

that was a one-off that we gave to

retailers to use in rabbit hunting

which is one of the things that a

certain mr taylor was particularly fond

of

they managed to link the twine that was

found on the body

to the twine that was found in his house

and link it back to that specific one

manufacturer to be able to connect the

dots

so pretty impressive stuff there as well

yeah crazy

you think that it's crazy but to be fair

both fiber id so the twine

and plastic id can be done just by

microscopy

this is a weird question maybe but this

can't be ruled as circumstantial

right no no it's a direct link between

the body and a source material found in

his home

like if they hadn't found a batch of

cable ties

in his bedside drawer that were the

exact same manufacturer

as the ones used by the royal mail

then the cable ties would have been

circumstantial because the cable ties

found at the body

would have been linked back to the ones

supplied by the royal mail

and he worked for the royal mail yeah

but because they were also found in his

bedside table

that then moves beyond the realm of

circumstantial

to hard evidence you've got a batch of

these cable ties

they have been used on this body must

have been you

and because it wasn't a cable tie

readily available to the to the general

public

yeah okay the same as the twine so if it

were just a

generic white string that he'd bought

from tesco

for example other retailers are

available it would have been

circumstantial evidence because you

can't link

that twine to the twine that was used on

the body

but because it was specifically made by

one company

that sold it to a specific batch of

retailers

and then they looked at the microscopy

and found that the twist direction was

the same the blend of fibers were the

same

any dye or manufacturing defects were

the same

it then moves beyond the realm of

circumstantial to being hard evidence

circumstantial evidence is enough to be

able to give you a hint

you wouldn't be able to as a jury member

say beyond reasonable doubt that this

piece of evidence

links this person to this crime when you

add them all together

which has been the case in previous

cases if you add a bunch of

circumstantial evidence

together then it's beyond reasonable

doubt

yeah then that all accumulates to become

beyond reasonable doubt but if you've

only got

a couple of bits then you can't really

prosecute on it

yeah well they do in america for example

but we have a much better legal system

than them

i would hope so yes okay were you going

to say something else because i was

going to talk about the pollen that was

\[ __ ] amazing i'm excited about the

pollen

actually ah mate the pollen

so i genuinely was so

fascinated reading this paper because i

was not taught anything

about pollen analysis during my course

so writing my notes i've done what

you've done and have blocked

capital written notes just like oh my

god this has blown my mind what has

happened

so for the listeners who are not aware

of the full details of the case

they brought in a pollen analyst

to look over any pollen

or biological detritus such as leaves

twigs

etc that were found on the body and to

be able

to narrow down where liane had been

previously whether she was kept in the

forest the whole time

which they sort of knew she hadn't

because of the cryobiology

but just wanted to be sure i think

that's probably

why they were able to and also

did all of the analysis of the body

because she still had soft tissue

it's much much easier to get the

approval

and financial backing to be able to do

all of these kind of

wacky out there tests when you've got

some kind of evidential basis to go by

yeah they probably wouldn't have even

bothered looking at the pollen

if she was in a nine-month state of

decay

that they would expect to see yeah so

they took

samples from her hair she had

some charcoal-like deposits

and other stuff in her hair

other stuff it took

swabs of her nasal cavity and

found some evidence on the bed covering

the aforementioned

floral that covering that she was

covered in

yeah so from these sample profiles

they managed to determine a bunch of

different plant varieties that were

non-native to the environment that she

was found in

so she was found in woodland and they

found

pollen or physical samples of

a privet hedge elder trees bramble

bushes

hawthorne trees a cherry or plum

or slow bush and buckler fern

so those are all like plants or bushes

they also

found pollen from beech and

poplar trees and the pollen profiles

were dominated by nettle pollen

and a thing called orachi or

orange if there's any plant people out

there

i apologize for butchering the

pronunciation of

whatever that word is the most

interesting thing for me

is that they looked at these pollen

profiles that they'd got from the body

and they came up with a scenario

or a place that was almost an exact

match for taylor's back garden so they

were like

judging by the amount of x y and z

it's probably in a garden that's got

an overgrown privet hedge that's

got overgrown nettles so it's not going

to be a well

manicured garden there will be fire pits

like you're just burning \[ __ ] in your

garden is that why they found the

charcoal

on her hair yeah because of the fire pit

oh

yeah and the thing that blew my mind

that was in block capitals

the beach and poplar pollen from the

trees

yeah they managed to say that these

two species of trees would

just be visible where the body was

oh my god they were like we found some

pollen

from a beech tree but it was only a

little bit and so

therefore a couple of gardens across

somewhere will have a beach tree growing

that is \[ __ ] crazy and mental

so once all of the other evidence had

linked

taylor to the crime they went to his

house

obviously went into his back garden and

test to your memory

his garden was overrun by a privet hedge

had a \[ __ ] ton of nettles he had plum

and damson trees there was a poplar

observable in the distance and there was

abundant buckler ferns

that is \[ __ ] crazy they also found

fungal remains so a bit of mushrooms

and charcoal remnants that under

microscopy were the same species

so the fungi were the same species that

were recovered on the body

as to the ones that were found in his

garden

the charcoal was an exact match so

obviously

wood or coal burns in a specific way

so if you've got a barbecue for instance

and you stick your hand in it that

charcoal will be unique to

coming from that barbecue that's so

crazy though

it gets even crazier they were like

there's quite

significantly large portions

of charcoal or burnt fragments that they

recovered in her hair

from which they were able to determine

almost

the exact positioning of her body

while he burnt \[ __ ] in his garden what

the \[ __ ]

i can theoretically understand this

but also i'm like why isn't this always

done i think it probably comes down to a

dead end

this in this situation is circumstantial

evidence

because it's highly likely that the same

ratio of plant matter would be found

in his next-door neighbor's garden yeah

if they also

left it to be overgrown so unless

there's actually a call

for doing it you're not gonna get any

evidence out of it

so i understand the frustration with

finding a case like this

and they've done absolutely everything

you can think of

and it's come to a nice conclusion in

that this guy's been found and sentenced

but if they didn't have any kind of link

to him

in the first place they wouldn't have

done

the pollen analysis yeah the twine

analysis would have come back

inconclusive they've been like yeah this

is just string

the plastic would have come back as this

is plastic

it's only because they got the

corroborating story

from his ex-girlfriends and then all of

the other evidence

linked itself together yeah that this

became possible to id him in such a way

that they got the positive

it's the problem with a lot of cold

cases is that you can recover

all of the material from the crime scene

so someone who's been sexually assaulted

and then murdered

you can recover a dna profile from any

semen deposit but if you haven't got

anyone in the database that matches it

and that's all the evidence you've got

that's where the case stops yeah because

there's nowhere to go

from that short of testing everybody in

the local area

which they did do in this case and

they've done it in a couple of

historical cases as well

the first dna case springs to mind i

don't

think they can do it anymore yeah but

also

i must command the west yorkshire police

yeah they did a really thorough job yeah

it was incredible which is refreshing

given the amount of cases we've done

where the police have been like

herp derp evidence

yeah it's been appalling in some cases

but yeah i've got one more bit so there

were also

carpet fibers that were recovered

from leanne's body whether it was the

body or a clothing i'm not sure

doesn't really matter they found some

carpet taylor had actually tried to be

clever

and had ripped up all of the carpet in

his house

which i think attributes to burn piles

in his garden it's either his carpet or

his dog

probably both what he wasn't smart

enough to do

was remove all of the carpet so when the

scenes of crimes officers popped into

his house

and looked into the corners of his

living room

he'd actually missed some carpet on some

of the nails that hold the carpet in

place

so like pluck popped that under a

microscope and what do you know

perfect match

wait perfect mask for what for the blood

i know the carpet

the carpet found on her body was the

perfect match

to the remnants of the carpet that was

found in his house so they were like

she was in here brah yeah yeah just do a

little mic

drop because now i've finished the

evidence

i'm out it's all you it was a lot of

\[ __ ] evidence it was crazy

i know right i'm \[ __ ] parched i read

some of it on the like wikipedia page

but that doesn't

really encompass all of the actual

evidence that was there

now you need a bit of me yeah

no i mean it i mean it anyone can

\[ __ ] google a microscope can't they

mate you ain't that special

so only one month after leanne's body

had been

found john taylor was charged

with her murder he pleaded guilty

and at the trial the judge stated that

john was a dangerous sexual sadist

who should expect to spend the rest of

his life

in custody when police added his dna to

their database

he was linked to two rape cases in

1988 and 1989

one of which had occurred on the same

footpath

where leanne had been abducted taylor

was found

guilty of these and received two further

life sentences

because of these rapes okay so

thank you so much for listening to

midweek murders

special thanks to jim and jordan

we appreciate you thank you thank you

okay

bye bye 

Ciao pow!
