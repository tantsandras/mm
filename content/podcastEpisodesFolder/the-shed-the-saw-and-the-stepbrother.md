Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

Bon bonjour bon bon bonjour bonjour bonjour bonjour bon bon bonjour. All right, hello, jesus.

Are you on your new headset? 

Yes, can't you tell?

Well, I would say that it's definitely... good. \[Laughter]

I waited that long for good? \[Laughter]

Hashtag disappointed.

\[Music]

Should we start? 

Probably, we've been going on for a while. \[Laughter] Someone started the topic of books and I was like "I've read a book blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah".

I'm probably gonna...

blah blah blah! 

...cut all of that because it spoils the ending of the book.

Yeah.

Yeah, all right. 

Also, I thought you were gonna cut out my impression of americans introducing the show, and then Jo came into my room the other day and she was like: "nice american accent by the way".

I didn't cut that.

You should do this introduction with your best english accent.

I can only do that when I'm drunk.

You are drunk. 

Otherwise I get too self-conscious.

Do it in whatever accent you feel comfortable, so long as it's not swedish.

I did it in a british accent once when I said like... 

You didn't because there's no such thing as a british accent.

An english accent okay. I did it in... I talked about our website, and then I talked about it in an english accent, and it was quite good. And you're never going to hear it but it was quite good.

Hello mates, this is Midweek Murders. That means it's time to talk about crime. I'm your host Sandra.

I would say it's probably a six out of ten. My english accent, your was a two.

My english accent is natural. If it's only a two...

Then what the hell are we speaking? 

We need to start assessing your rating system.

No, your impression of one. Your impression of me doing an impression of one.

So, okay. It is... Now I'm self-cautious about it \[laughter]. It's wednesday which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders. I'm your host sandra...That's you. It's you. 

Oh and I'm also your host? Co-host? Subject? Guest? Sir? Peasant? I'm your peasant, Joe! \[Laughter]

Are we gonna have to do it again or should we just use that one?

Just use it. It's my least favorite part about the whole production it's this fucking introduction.

I usually tell you to do it and then you do it very ridiculously, but then I keep that in.

But that's why it's funny. I could do a different...

It's Wednesday my dudes!

I could do a different accent every time we do it and the listeners be like: "where are we? Are we in Australia? Are we in Ireland? Are we in Wales? Are we in Nigeria?".

What accent do you want to do this time? 

I'll do it in welsh. Hello! You're listening to Midweek Murders. And that means it's time to talk about crime. I'm your host Joe, and this is your co-host...

Sandra!

Sandra.

I was gonna say that it was quite good until you said Sandra. 

Yeah, I was imitating you but through through a welsh accent. \[Laughter]

This week we're going to talk about the murder of Becky Watts. I got my information from wikipedia, Casefile: True Crime Podcast, a Guardian article by Steven Morris and The Murder of Becky Watts - The Police Tapes. It was just Police Tapes, sorry. 

I watched that as well. Did you did you watch it or did you just read the transcripts?

No, I watched it. 

Yeah, I watched it too.

It's a small world. 

I did my research over a week ago, so I'll be fucked if I can remember where I read my sources from. But you can find them all on our website midweekmurders.netlify.app \[Laughter]

Wow, wonderful. 

Other websites are available.

No, they're not. 

But not for our podcast. \[Laughter]

There's only one true source of true crime... 

And his name is Bane. 

I thought you were gonna say "his name is Sauron" for some reason, I don't know why. You know that we talk about Harry Potter almost every episode? 

That's because it's the best non-fiction story that ever existed.

Are you excited about the new game?

Yeah, but it does mean that I'll have to purchase a PS5 which are like 500 pounds.

Are they only releasing it on PS5, not... 

I think so but it, yeah, means that I would get to play the Witcher 3 in their spunked up new high definition version.

I really want it to be on computer because...

I think they are releasing it on PC as well. 

Oh! Wait, the Witcher or the Harry Potter game? 

Harry Potter.

Thank god for that. 

I think it's gonna be PC but I'm not sure Niklas' laptop will be able to cope with it.

Maybe now that he operated on it.

Thermal paste or not. But I think it's only going to be PC, Xbox whatever the new one is, and PS5. 

Nobody cares about the new Xbox.

No they do not. 

Okay, so... 

We've done sources, start with the crime. Let's do this shit, it's getting late. I've got a bedtime. 

I didn't talk about a book for 40 minutes. 

Hey, shut your face.

So Becky Watts was a 16 year old girl who lived with her father and her stepmother in Bristol. She had been badly bullied for years, and thus was painfully shy with strangers. But in 2015 she was a lot happier though, having found a close-knit friend group with whom she would often hang out with, and a boyfriend who adored her. She had a very good relationship with her stepmother Anji, who had supported Becky through her traumatic school years, and who treated Becky as if she were her own daughter. Anji had a son, Nathan Matthews and Nathan's girlfriend Shauna Hoare worked as Anji's primary caretaker as Anji suffered from multiple sclerosis, and could no longer move about freely in her home. And I would just like to get it out of the way, but Hoare is a very unfortunate last name.

For the benefit of our listeners, it is spelled H-o-a-r-e.

Yes. I just felt like that needed to be said.

Yeah, I was reading it and I was like: "is it pronounced Hoare? Is it?" and then watched the Police Tapes and they were like: "I'm Shauna Hoare".

Okay. On the morning of the 19th of February 2015, Becky gets back home from having spent the night at a friend's house. Anji comes to the door to let her in as Becky's house key didn't work. Anji leaves the house at 11.15 to go to a doctor's appointment. When she leaves Becky, Nathan and Shauna are still in the house. Later that day Becky's boyfriend goes to her house to see if Becky is there, because she hadn't been responding to his messages, which was very out of character especially because they had made plans and she... 

They were in love.

She didn't call him to say that she was doing something else or anything, so he went to the house...

Bitch! She's socially anxious, she ain't gonna call you.

No, that's you.

Take it from me bro. \[Laughter]

At first, Becky's family assumed that she must have gone to another friend's house, as she didn't have school the next day. I think it was some kind of... 

Can I just interject?

Yeah. 

I don't know if it's the alcohol, but you sound a bit like Gollum when you say friendsies. Because it's just friends. Not friendsies.

it's like shreds are our friends

I don't mean to correct your english, because I know it's usually on point, but I'm really struggling not to laugh every time you say friends. Because all I can picture is you eating a raw fish out of a river.

no don't do it scary

\[Laughter]

\[Laughter]

at first becky's family assumed that she

must have gone to another friend's

house

sorry i should have muted my microphone

i knew

you were gonna do that

you're doing great

\[Laughter]

i she didn't have school the next day

and there i

almost put like it was a school holiday

but then i didn't know if that was the

correct term

could have just been a weekend no it was

like

a school holiday oh then yeah school

holiday is fine

her laptop and phone wasn't in the house

and nathan and shauna said that they had

heard becky leave the house that morning

but hadn't spoken or seen her

they left messages and called her but

they trusted becky to go

out as they knew all of her friends well

they assumed that she would get in touch

with them soon

the day after on the 20th of february

angie called becky's father darren at

work

and asked him to come home as becky's

friends

and boyfriend had all showed up at their

house

as she hadn't been responding to

messages

darren gets home and speaks to her

friend

and to the neighbors after which he

decides to

report becky missing to the police

he also looks at her facebook to see if

she had posted anything that could help

them figure out where she was

but becky hadn't posted anything

darren also asks nathan friend jesus

asks nathan to help write up a post

right sorry i'd muted my microphone

and then i just had to put it back on to

laugh at the front seat

you don't have to mute it anymore

because i can't hear your background

noises because you've got a new

but i feel like

it would just cut out the unnecessary

editing of my burps

you might have to do that again darren

also asks

nathan to help write up a post on

facebook

that showed a photo of her and the

pleading message

to help them find becky because they

were

a bit scared that the police didn't take

them seriously because a lot of

teenagers go missing on the 23rd

of february darren and becky's

grandmother

pat makes a televised press appeal they

beg

anyone that has information about becky

to come forward

and they also speak directly to becky

assuring her that she isn't in any

trouble

and they just want to know that she's

okay

on the 25th the police removed the

house's

residence and do a search of the family

home

becky's family and friends organized the

search of the area

on the 28th the police arrest two people

in connection of becky's disappearance

and five days later the police announced

to the press that

they had found body parts belonging to

becky

the same two people are arrested again

on suspicion of

murder the people arrested

are nathan and shauna becky's

stepbrother and

his girlfriend turns out that when

police searched the home

not the first time but later on i guess

i couldn't get

a proper like date on that did you have

a date or when they found the blood

no okay

turns out when the police searched the

home

probably not the first time they had

found

sorry it must have been the first time

because it was the blood on the door jam

yeah and that would have been when the

forensics officers

went in yeah i think they went in

several times

but it could have been the first time

they had found blood

on the doorframe of becky's room and a

fingerprint

in the blood and the fingerprint turned

out

to be a match for nathan's fingerprints

the police had tried interviewing nathan

and shawna previously

but they had left to go visit shauna's

mother even though the

mother and daughter were stranged

at a visit to the couple's house the

police had noticed the state of disorder

and chaos in the house

as nathan was a hoarder but the bathtub

had been spotless it's worth pointing

out here

that when i first read this and it was

just

like a summary of the details of what

went

on and you think okay he's a hoarder

i consider myself a hoarder i can still

see my carpet

and can access all of the rooms that i

need access to

when we speak of nathan and shawna's

house

it's in such a state of disarray

that there were rooms that the forensic

officers did not know existed

because of the level of hoarding that

was going on

you had to move things out of the way

to be able to get to certain places

every surface was covered the floor

was completely non-visible everything

was stacked up against the walls so the

ceiling

and then they got into the bathroom

and even the bathroom itself was

completely

full to the ceiling of stuff

apart from the bath which was

absolutely spotless like

ocd level clean yeah another thing to

know

here is that nathan had been part of

some kind of military civilians thing

i think i can't back you up on that i

don't know

but it's called something like but he

had been a part of it and he had

learned how to clean things properly

through

that not that he ever territorial army

maybe

i don't remember like the fair you've

had

two bottles of wine that's not even true

i saw the videotapes like the thing that

we

both saw i think of the house

yeah it was a \[ __ ] mess and i would

never be able to live like that

never ever it was neither would i like

i keep pretty bottles of whiskey

and every single book i've ever read but

even to me that house was a mess

it was horrible any kind of

anything that has entered that house

has not left junk mail boxes

food containers newspapers

anything you can imagine that has

entered that household

will have never left apart from

the bath which was sparkly

i'd put myself in that bath if there

hadn't been a

murdered body in it and step a also

in that house because we both have oh

no yeah but i mean if someone were

reselling that bath i'd be like well

that's sparkly clean i'll have it

\[Laughter]

whereas if someone was putting that

house up for sale i'd be like i don't

know what kind of cockroaches

uh in all of these cardboard boxes oh it

was so

horrible it was it was really bad these

are the kind of people that you see on

the reality tv

shows where they've got clinical ocd

and can't dispose of anything so they

get an expert in to help them

and for me i get anxiety just if there's

too much stuff accumulating in any place

i get anxiety throwing things away

so i got the lego diagon alley

and i've still got the box of the lego

sitting in front of my clothing rack

because part of me doesn't want to throw

it away part of me is thinking

like well what happens when you move

you'll need to put it all in bags and

where are you going to put the bags well

the best place to put the bags is in the

box

so keep the box but i know the box is

useless because i can put the bags in

another box

but it's the box so

i completely no i will try

no i i i i honestly think i have

some kind of problem and we'll just

leave that at that and we'll generalize

some kind of problem but i can

completely

associate with hoarders

yeah i know but the state of their house

i think is the next level

yeah to be fair i've seen similar houses

and it's people that

clinically suffer with severe ocd

like the kind of turning the

light switches off and on like 14 times

to make sure that you've turned it off

kind of thing and locking their door

multiple times to make sure that it's

locked

i get that it can be a neurosis and

i think to some extent we both suffer

from that

to different degrees and in different

those things that you just said more or

less

yeah but you have the problem of

worrying about ovens and locked doors

and hobs and things like that i think

it's fair to say

yes whereas i have the hoarder side of

things

where i will keep non-sentimental things

that mean

nothing to me they will stay until i get

into a mood where i'm like right let's

just

throw everything away but

was like a combination of the worst

aspects of both of us but to be fair

i'm not sure that any of them have the

problems that we have i'm not sure it's

just like

no no we're unique

i think it must be psychological to the

extent of

the mess that they had i don't think

that just

comes down to like laziness of not

taking the bins out

or like a distraction from something

else

i think there's got to be an underlining

condition of some kind of

obsessive-compulsive

disorder that makes one of them and we

don't know which one because it was

never

investigated but one of them must have

some kind of disorder that makes it

difficult

for them to dispose of things

to a level that an ocd hoarder would

put emphasis on something like the shows

that i've watched

where they've helped a hoarder dispose

of things

they would have like newspapers from the

1970s

and they wouldn't want to throw that

away in case there was an article in

there that related to something that

might be happening nowadays

and i think that's the only reason that

you can keep a newspaper for that long

is that you've got that obsessive

compulsive

irrationality to think that it might

hold something relevant to you in the

present day

and i think that's the only way that you

can get to the level of hoarding that

we've seen

in that house is to have that kind of

serious neurological disorder i'm not

sure about that they had so much

trash around so much food around

that just went bad and stuff like that

i'm not sure

that that's a neurological disorder but

it might be

i mean i can't wait

it doesn't matter but this is the kind

of thing that i find

interesting so \[ __ ] you

sorry i amused myself

you're like oh true crime i'm like oh

ocd

oh i agree with you in the from

the forensics body cams that we saw

it did look mainly like

absolute rubbish it was bags of things

they went into the kitchen and it was

like

empty tins of whatever

but when you're suffering from that

degree of ocd

everything has a significance

and what that significance is

yes and even the empty tins of baked

beans

everything to the broken mind

of someone that has that

level of ocd has a level of significance

i don't want to keep harping on about it

but when you watch these programs where

people go in and try to help

clear the clutter of someone that

is on this level that person

really struggles to let go of anything

i'm almost 100 convinced that either

nathan or shauna

and i think it more likely to be nathan

having watched the videos

would have had that level of obsessive

compulsive hoarding

where he would assign a value

to even rubbish nothing that could

possibly mean anything to anyone

but maybe in his mind this

container that had a chicken jowl crazy

that we bought

on the 15th of august

was when shauna said that she loved me

and therefore i'm holding on to this

because it's a reminder of that time

that she showed me

her affection it has to be that degree

of ocd

i don't think it does i understand what

you're saying

but i think that if you're on one level

of

i would say probably depression you just

stop

caring about \[ __ ] so you stop cleaning

you stop all of those kind of \[ __ ] i've

read a lot about

or i haven't read a lot about it but i

have read

some about it of shauna and

nathan's relationship and they were

mostly

just in the bed at all times because

they didn't

yeah they were no

they didn't have a free surface in the

home

because he would take things back to

their house to fix them

and then resell them he wanted not to be

poor

kind of but i'm not sure i think that

you are protecting your own feelings

on this okay shut your mouth i would say

i like material things okay

buy me things but i would also

say that one thing that they did

keep that was detrimental for them

was that they kept the receipts

for gloves face masks and

yes that the police

found on their search of the home

i just want to put out another point and

i know

you've disregarded me as

projecting my own feelings um

i studied psychology

if you were living

as a rationally sane human being

which we're assuming one of the two of

them was

with me so far would you not

put up some kind of

refusal or resistance

to the other under their degree of

hoarding

if it weren't to the clinical

significance that i think it was if you

as shauna were living with him and

knew that it wasn't to the degree that

it was

mentally problematic for him to discard

things

would you not try and encourage him to

get rid of some of the \[ __ ]

that was in their house the thing is and

this is going to be a point later on

oh here we go but sure

oh no wait you didn't mean post

recording

\[Laughter]

this is you projecting feelings that's

what i'm saying

i just can't get over you telling me to

throw my things away

shauna wasn't even allowed to leave the

house

without nathan because he was extremely

jealous and possessive of her when they

first got together

nathan was maybe 19

and shawna was like 13 and shauna had a

very disruptive

childhood so if she thinks

that nobody's ever gonna love her and

nathan

takes her on as like okay we'll be

together and they

are together and then that abuse

is just gonna be worse and worse

\[Music]

how much say does she have in their home

life

i would say probably none does he abuse

her

i would say yes i completely understand

where you're coming from

but i think everybody has underplayed

the statement of hoarding and i mean to

be honest

reflecting on this is probably

irrelevant like

shut up

the degree of hoarding and ocd

isn't relevant to the case at all i just

find it fascinating

we could probably skip past it let's

just the next point

yes it's important to know

the level of hoarding that was in their

house

in comparison to the bathroom

yes or the bath specifically that was

completely spotless

but for me that was one of the most

interesting

points in the case and i know it

shouldn't have been because we were

looking at the murder

but it was like this guy's got issues

because i don't think it's shauna the

way that she presented herself in the

interviews

and the control she had over herself

telling lies like

she was the trickster shauna was like

completely stone-faced throughout the

whole thing

she was like no this never happened no

he never told me anything

no we live a completely normal life and

then nathan was like nah did it

i don't agree but we'll get to it oh

\[ __ ] you now you never agree with me

why can't you just decide that i'm right

for once

well get to it we can have this later

okay

you're just gonna bring it up as an

argument after we've stopped recording

\[Laughter]

okay so

i just give me five minutes

i've amused myself

\[Laughter]

i'm amused myself

fyi don't believe that for a second it's

the whiskey talking

\[Laughter]

okay okay okay okay do the case i'm

ready

okay so the trial begins on the 6th

of october the prosecution lays out the

order of events

like this the couple planned the attack

as they had

messaged each other beforehand talking

about

kidnapping a schoolgirl as nathan had a

sexual interest in

underage girls these text messages had

been

deleted but later restored

by the police shauna had been underage

when the pair started dating

they also had stun guns handcuffs tape

and masks

in their car prior to the events on the

19th

nathan described his relationship to

becky astrid

as he didn't appreciate her behavior

towards his mother

and then i wrote in parentheses lies

because becky was perfectly fine with

her stepmother they had a very close

relationship

becky's friend told police that nathan

had told becky that he was going to

murder her and how he was going to

murder her

years before this happened he claimed in

a written confession that he had planned

to kidnap her as a plot to scare her

straight as he perceived her behavior

as being spoiled nathan claimed that his

mask had

slipped off during the attempted

kidnapping

and as his identity had been revealed

he panicked and accidentally killed her

and then i wrote in parentheses lies

the prosecution claimed that the

kidnapping plot was sexually motivated

because of the previous

text messages between shauna and nathan

where they more or less had said several

times

like bring me home school girls

and sean had been like oh i saw a really

pretty school girl

that i thought that i would bump on the

head

and like take home for you blah blah

blah

i've got the direct quote

if you want to include that rather than

bump on the head blah blah blah

it was very pretty petite girl

almost knocked her out to bring her home

lol yeah which is also

quite showing as we're gonna get to

well we're probably not going to get to

it so let's do it now

so his police interview before he

confessed to her murder

was that he was trying to scare her

because he was insulted

about the way that he spoke to their

mother

everybody in the family quite clearly

knew

that he didn't like her

so he said that he wanted to try and

scare her and his

tactic was to

while he was masked he was gonna

stick her in a suitcase he was gonna gag

her put her in the back of the car and

take her to a wooden

area where he was going to scare her and

threaten her

and tell her that she needed to show

more respect to her parents

so he knocked on a door went into a room

said can i have a quick word actually

while i'm recalling all of this his

whole technique

was to disguise that it was him

right yes he said in his confession yes

so he's in a balaclava or

some kind of face covering so she can't

identify

visually that it's him but she's right

on her yeah

his whole perspective is that she should

not becky watts should not know

that it is he nathan matthews

that is conducting this abduction

so he puts on a mask or a balaclava

or whatever to cover his face so that

she can't identify him

and he knocks on her door and then

says can i have a word

with you yeah now

ponder me this

if your brother knocked on your door

and said could i have a word with you

you would recognize their voice yes

which is why i said

lies and then you say yes

of course my dear beloved brother

you may enter my private abode

and speak upon me thusly and then

some strange masked

obscured gentleman

walks into your bedroom the \[ __ ] you

gonna

think we all know that this is oh

hell no this is my brother under the

mask

we all know it's his brother under the

man what the hell

going on there your plan \[ __ ]

\[ __ ]

bruh it was never a plan what is this

bollocks that's never the plan it's just

a lie

that he told during no his whole

original plan that he disclosed to the

police once he

realized he'd been caught is that he

wanted

no i don't think it was that was never

the plan

because she never treated her family

bad they would also say the same they

did also say the same what's the point

behind the whole abduction

it's a sexually motivated murder that

was what they were convicted of

i mean they were convicted of murder

yeah but

said

doggo the prosecution also said

that this was never a plot to

kidnap her and say like oh you treated

my mother

wrong because she never treated her

stepmother wrongly and also

because both nathan and shauna had a

past behavior of

trying to get underage school girls to

have sex with them

nathan got caught by his

stepfather becky's father

with a car full of 12 year olds

he drove home a car full of 12 year old

school girls

before he met shawna who was 13

when they first started dating and he

was an adult

he drove them yeah and darren

fought him and was like not fought him

physically

but he screamed at me being like your

\[ __ ]

\[ __ ] bring these girls home

so he forced nathan to drive these 12

year old girls home

he didn't like becky probably i would

say

because he was jealous of the

relationship

that becky had with his own mother

yeah and he made that very clear with

the family that he didn't like

like both the parents were well aware

that

he did not like becky they also

asked his mother his own mother

do you believe that nathan accidentally

killed

becky and she said no so he wasn't

trying to kidnap her

to try to scare her straight that was

never a thing

okay fair enough uh to the police yeah

to try and make a lesser charge yeah

yeah okay as i said after the murder

yes i said i was right the whole time

\[Laughter]

after the murder they had put the body

in the boot of their car

and then spent hours in the family home

afterwards before going back to their

own house

in the bathroom of their house their own

house

they dismembered the body with a

circular saw

nathan claimed that he had done this by

himself and that shona had no idea what

he was doing

as he had told her the drain pipe was

clogged

and then i said again in parentheses

lies because nobody could have a

circular saw in their own house and not

hear it that's impossible and also

the \[ __ ] the connection with the

drainpipe

yeah no that makes no sense nathan was

caught on cctv

the day after the murder buying the

circular saw

as well as goggles gloves and face masks

and the couple were also caught on cctv

buying cleaning products

to get rid of the evidence in the

bathroom

the days afterwards after this hint

readers that's why we emphasize the

cleanliness of the bath

yes you're welcome and by readers

i mean listeners after this the couple

put the body parts in bags and boxes

and paid a very large sum of money to a

friend of nathan's

to store the bags and boxes in his shed

a couple of hundred meters away from

nathan and shawna's home

angie claims that shauna was the brains

of the crime

although shauna wasn't even allowed to

step outside the home

without nathan because he was jealous

and possessive

to be fair having seen the police tapes

i can quite easily see

shauna being the brains behind the whole

thing

she seemed so calm and so

assured of herself whereas

nathan although he seemed relaxed

did have a kind of nervous energy behind

him

whereas shauna seems so confident

in herself that i would

not doubt at all there was originally

her idea to do the whole thing

i don't agree at all like oh well

why don't you go \[ __ ] on your face like

boo deal

i saw the police tapes as well and

shauna

giggles and is nervous

the whole time i would disagree with

that she

looks nervous to start with but then

when you start to see

the rest of the first interview and the

second interview

and the third and however long it goes

for she seems

absolutely in control of everything

and even to the point where it's

established

that the murder was done

by nathan and possibly her as an

accomplice

she's like i knew nothing about that

this is the first time i've heard

anything about

like she seems so in control

that i would say she were the brains

behind it

and before you comment

like i know you will

you may have more experience

in psychology but i've got more

experience in forensic science

and therefore i win

and that's my point

i don't doubt for one second that shauna

was in on the plan

but shauna was being controlled

in their relationship by nathan

and that is documented

she wasn't allowed to go outside of the

home

without nathan because he

thought that she would do whatever

with other guys he was like oh she's

trying to sleep with other guests blah

blah blah

nathan was a predator

when they first got together because he

was an adult

and she was 13 years old

no i get that i'm not but also i'm not

to what extent

did she allow that persona to be

believed externally so that she could

control nathan

i don't think she controlled nathan at

all i think

that she didn't know what love was

as a third i mean if she controlled

nathan then maybe she could have gotten

to throw away some of this \[ __ ]

that's what i'm saying like if she had

any kind of say

maybe she would have been like don't

bring home

all the fridges that you were gonna fix

up and

sell on the fridges

we've got it now fridges well he did

bring home like those kind of stuff and

they just sat around the house

she had no say in their sex

life he was a documented predator

before she met him before he met her

they yeah because of the 12 year olds

if it was that documented with the

police

no was that no that was just hearsay

evidence from his dad

and his mom everybody knew about it they

yeah but you can't say it's documented

if it's not official

well they just assumed

that he would no i get it he was proper

dodge

he was proper dodge and he had

sorry you moosed yourself again

he was prepared

and you're a moose not your immune

it was a moose

no he was he was on his computer

super creep on his computer

there was a lot of underage porn

not child pornography but like

legal age but dressing down

yeah exactly yeah this was

not shawna this was nathan

that's what i'm trying to say

and shauna's dna was found on a face

mask

and on a bag which contained becky's

remains

which conclusively linked her to the

crime

so what i'm trying to do shauna was

not a bystander and she

was not innocent of the crime definitely

an accomplice

yes so she wasn't innocent

in any way but i'm just trying to put it

in perspective

she may not have been guilty of murder

but she was definitely complicit in the

murder

i think she was and i think she should

have

been prosecuted as a murderer but given

her family context the context of her

nation's relationship the context of

nathan

being extremely weird

for a long time i would say

i don't think she was under any

illusions as to what she were doing

i think she knew exactly what they were

doing

i think so too but do i think that

she made nathan do it 100

no no it definitely came from

him yeah and he definitely convinced her

to get on board with it yeah but

did she commit the actual murder

no did she assist

in obscuring the murder

definitely yes i think she might have

been there when the murder happened

and might have helped him do it but i

think

this is nathan's sexual fantasy

i think it was both of their sexual

fantasy

judging by the text messages that were

exchanged between them

but i would 100

say that nathan committed the crime

and that shawna was the accomplice

i don't think she had a direct

role in the murder

yeah but the whole abduction

scare that wasn't even a sexual

like the whole background

to it i think she was completely

involved in

yeah she was 100 aware of

yeah but were her hands the hands that

committed the murder

no no that was something

yeah i think it's 100 correct

that nathan be charged with the murder

and that shawna be charged with

an accomplice and pervert in the course

of justice

and whatever else she was charged with

i think it's right in my nose notes

nathan was saying my notes

notesies nathan was sentenced to a

minimum

term of 33 years

and shauna was sentenced to

17 years in prison both were also

convicted of

conspiracy to kidnap perverting the

course of justice

preventing the lawful burial of a body

and protection of two stun guns which

i'm assuming

is illegal yes yeah

so so go through the charges one by one

slowly

so the first charge conspiracy to kidnap

yeah so that was because

of nathan's confession where he said

they were intending to kidnap her to

scare her

because of the way that she spoke to

and treated their mum no that was

because the prosecution

thought that the plans was to kidnap her

and

sexually assault her and they had the

means to do that

in their car before this happened they

had

handcuffs tape that's what nathan

confessed to

yeah but the prosecution is saying it

was sexually motivated

it wasn't a kidnap plan to scare her

because of her treatment of her parents

that was obviously a lie

they are saying that the plans to kidnap

her

was because they were just because of

the sexual

relations okay fine okay so the next

charge

perverting the course of justice yeah

because they both lied during their

interview process

yeah preventing the lawful burial of a

body

because they hid it in the shed yeah and

wouldn't

disclose to anyone where it was yeah

that's fine

and possession of two stun guns yeah

when she resisted going with them

because you know

when strange people enter your bedroom

and they're like

you come with me you're like um

no no not gonna do that

no his friend and his friend's

girlfriend who had stored the body parts

were also

oh yeah yeah the other ones

there was loads of them jamie ireland

donovan demetrius carl demetrius

and jaden parsons were all

involved in hiding

all of those body parts in their \[ __ ]

shed you all deserve to rot in prison

you dirty \[ __ ] bastards

i think they saw that it was drugs or

something because they were

definitely knew that it was

something illegal was happening yeah

so do you know what they were actually

charged with

they were charged with perverting the

course of justice

probably aiding and abetting

assisting an offender yeah

aiding and a betting basically yeah so

all four of them

no only two the ones that had

the demetrius the guy who had

the shed and his girlfriend okay

both knew about it like not about what

the

things no but they knew they were

storing

something suspicious yes

i 100 understand why

they got sentenced but i don't think

it's that serious which is probably

reflected

in their personal sentence i think one

of them got

two years the other one got like 16

months

which is understandable because they

knew

that it was illegal in some way but they

thought that it was drugs

but also probably with the news

at the time like this whole find

becky thing on social media went

viral so they would have probably yes

my dick pics so they would have probably

suspected i mean but something

suspicious was happening

yeah and they knew that nathan was her

step brother like they probably thought

that it was drugs

when they first got it but then after

the news

i'm kind of leaning towards that they

figured it out

because you would have to be an idiot

to not figure it out well we don't know

their intelligence levels

they could have been complete \[ __ ]

morons

\[Laughter]

but i mean like you would have known

even if you had it in your shed

already you would have i mean yeah

your mate comes up to you and is like

hey

can i store this suspicious

black bag full of stuff that you're

not allowed to look at in your shed

and then the next day on the news

they're like ah

teenagers gone missing people like

i might have a peek in that bag

but no either they were completely

trustworthy

of their mate who just turned up with a

bag full of

nondescript items or they were like

yeah this is fishy but you know my

homeboy

he does me a solid so i don't

even think that he was friends with the

guy who put it in

his shed i think that he was friends

with like his brother

who was also charged yeah they were

two demetriuses no donovan

and carl either way whoever

of the demetriuses

decided to store dead body parts

in their shed should have been

suspicious

that was the one that got charged but i

think

that he first talked to his brother

i don't know if this is just my sense of

curiosity

but if someone gave me a really

heavy bag it would have been if it was

yeah if it was body parts so

dead weight of the human body is heavy

it was and someone turns up at your door

with like a double bagged bin liner

and a bunch of boxes and they're like

hey

can i store this in your shed don't

look in it i'll come back for it you'd

be like

i'm gonna have a peek i know i would if

you came round to my house

my flat i don't live in a house and

we're like hey

here's a bag don't look in it i'll come

get it

in like two weeks time i'd be like i'm

looking in that \[ __ ] bag

yeah i think most people would yeah yeah

nobody trusts your mate coming around

and being like don't look in this

\[ __ ] bag that stinks

of human decay and i'm gonna come get in

a bit

but you know ignore all of the police

reports about this missing person

like a lot of money which would only

peak my interest more yeah

to no way a rational person

per person i've turned into sean connery

my name's james bond

no way a rational person would

have accepted nondescript bin liners

and boxes to store in their shed

or outhouse or water closet

or whatever the \[ __ ] kind of cubby hole

they put in

without being suspicious and therefore

monsieur dimitrius

you \[ __ ] deserved everything you got

what are you thinking about doing now

going to bed

are you gonna sleep asleep i might watch

another episode

of two weeks to live

are you on the toilet

the bathroom

got a poop coming okay so maybe we

should say goodbye
