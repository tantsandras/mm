Dr (in air quotes) Hawley Harvey Crippen, who was put on trial for murdering his wife Cora Crippen (stage name Belle Elmore), is the infamous snake oil selling criminal we're discussing in this episode. Joe (the hormone monster) feels like his forensic education is under scrutiny, and Sandra reads telegrams and gets told she needs to get out more.

Sandra got her information wikipedia, as well as these articles:

Joe got his information from wikipedia, which is also where we found the images:
