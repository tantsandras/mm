  Midweek Murders contains graphic and
  explicit content,
  listener discretion is advised. He did a
  very good job
  in vikings, the series, he was like the
  weird
  magic guy and... Oh yeah
  the typical character that's cast in all
  of these
  historical documentaries, the magic
  guy. He made
  boats, so not that magic I guess.
  No you're a typical shipwright carpenter,
  the magic guy is probably the
  least
  apt description for someone who makes
  boats.
  I think it was like, because he's
  very like... Go and see the magic guy!
  You need a special remedy? Oh what can he
  help me with?
  Well if you need to get across a small
  body of water,
  he's your guy.
  But i've got pancreatitis. Well, you know,
  maybe open water will help.
  [Music]
  Oh wait no i've got another impression.
  Yeah?
  I can do harry potter
  impersonating aragog. What
  the fuck, and also please
  do it. So I assume you've seen
  the films at least once? Yeah. But in
  yeah, in half blood prince harry takes
  the
  felix felicis to get their memories
  from slughorn, remember that? Yep.
  So I don't know if they included it in... I
  know they definitely included it in the
  books. Duh
  [Laughter]
  So the whole point of taking the felix
  felicis is to go and meet slughorn and
  to get
  the memories of riddle for the horcruxes.
  So both in the book and the film,
  harry's like you know what, I'm actually
  going to go and see
  hagrid. I just got a really good feeling
  about this,
  hagrid's gonna be great! And then on his
  way
  to meet hagrid he comes across slughorn
  collecting tentacular leaves
  for a potion and he sneaks up on him, and
  I don't know if this is in the books but
  it's definitely in the films,
  harry acts like he's kind of drunk.
  So aragog's dead and slughorn
  asks to collect some of the venom
  from his pincers and then harry's like,
  ah yeah, but you know don't forget that
  and does like a little finger motion
  with his two index
  fingers to imitate aragog's pincers.
  And that that was my impression of harry
  impersonating aragog.
  Was just (clicking noise).
  Because I was like, this does not
  translate in a podcast.
  Okay so are you ready to start the case?
  You're listening to Midweek
  Murders,
  that means it's time to talk about crime.
  I'm your host jay bear
  and this is... (whispers "It's your turn").
  Is Sandra!
  Listen to our podcast
  we're hilarious!
  We talk about crime, we make some
  funnies...
  You sound like a character on the one
  with the
  puberty monster. I'm the fucking
  hormone fairy! What is it called?
  (sings "I'm going through changes").
  What is it called? I don't remember. Me
  neither.
  If this makes it into the cut. Fucking
  hormone fairy?!
  I'm the puberty monster! Yeah
  people are gonna scream at us being like
  it's called this, you
  morons. We've got a lot going on okay?
  We have a very stressful life. You guys
  need to chill the fuck out, yeah? You
  listen to this for pleasure,
  just chill out with the comments, okay?
  We never receive any comments it would
  be nice if somebody could speak to us.
  We're very lonely. This is funny.
  So true.
  Okay you're listening to midweek murders,
  I'm your host sandra. And I'm your
  co-host
  Joe. So the case we're gonna talk about
  today is Hawley Harvey Crippen
  and my references is:
  britannica biography
  about Hawley Harvey... Hawley Harvey
  Hawley?! Hawley Harvey Crippen,
  what a fucking joke!
  Written by the editors of encyclopedia
  britannica.
  The oldie.co.uk, which I first thought
  was a website about me.
  The article it's called
  mutilating the evidence, and it's a blog
  by Bob Woffinden.
  Bob?! Bob?! What a fucking
  guy! I love Bob.
  I also read... He comes from the bronx,
  everybody loves Bob.
  I also read about the victim
  in into the limelight
  dot org which is funny, because i thought
  that thing was like dead in the 90s,
  dot org? But it's still kicking. And
  the history press.co.uk
  extracted from a century of london
  murders and executions,
  by John J Eddleston.
  You know dot org just means it's a
  website for a specific
  organization like,
  dot co dot uk,
  is a company from the uk.
  And dot com is the us,
  and dot d e is from
  germany. Like dot org is not a thing that
  only existed in the 90s,
  it's still very much
  a live domain for any organization
  that is international. Okay,
  I should have known that. I did not. You
  should have known that
  given you're the tech freak in this
  whole dynamic.
  Yeah yeah yeah in this whole dynamic.
  I got my information from
  wiki wiki waa, wikipedia.
  Didn't you research evidence that said
  he was
  innocent? I already
  know about mitochondrial dna from my
  forensics
  training, so if you want to reference
  that,
  that was from anglia ruskin university
  2010 until 2013.
  You're welcome. Okay
  oh god, I have a forensic science
  bsc
  honorary degree 2.1, does anybody
  need
  my personal bank details?
  Don't do that we'll already given them...
  Never
  felt so much under scrutiny
  than i have right now for my fucking
  forensic education.
  We've already given them our birthdays.
  Oh, no one's gonna remember because
  nobody knows that 9 11 happened in
  september.
  The disappearance of, and this is
  strange, but there's lots and lots of
  different names in here.
  And this woman who was born
  konigunde makamotsky,
  changed her name to cora turner
  in the u.s because she was living there
  with her parents,
  and then changed her name again
  to Belle Elmore which was her stage name.
  She married Hawley Crippen.
  Hawley Crippen. Sorry Hawley.
  No way.
  What kind of bronx are you living in
  chump?! Not any kind of bronx
  just london england.
  Ey up govna', I can do
  the english! Oh yeah
  she was 11 years younger than he was
  when they married, and then they moved
  to london england,
  and moved into a house
  in hilldrop crescent which is
  very very close to where I live. Don't
  tell them that, you fucking internet
  amateur.
  Very, very far away from
  anybody associated with this podcast.
  Yes cut that over
  so that it appears really awkward.
  They moved into there because they
  wanted
  separate bedrooms and they also had
  lodgers.
  And they had a party at their home
  on the 31st of january 1910
  where one of the guests wanted to go to
  the
  bathroom, and she got annoyed
  at her husband because the husband
  didn't
  show him to the bathroom, so she was like
  this is not
  the proper way to treat guests. And then
  when they left the party,
  that was the last time anyone saw her.
  And she was a very
  colorful character, she was,
  as I read it in the sources, not a very
  good music hall performer.
  She tried to be an opera singer, didn't
  work out, she tried to be a vaudeville
  entertainer, didn't work out. And
  she once during the strike of
  music hall artists she arrived to perform
  at the theater and one of the protesters
  that was supporting the strike was like
  oh
  let her in, because everyone is gonna
  leave anyway.
  Oh savage! So savage, yeah. Police first heard of
  Coras disappearance
  from her friend, the strong woman
  Kate Williams better known as Vulcana.
  And I was like, good lord let there be a
  picture,
  and there was a picture of strong woman
  Vulcana which is so... Did she look sexy?
  Oh yeah she was very strong, very strong.
  Look at the source, it's a very good
  picture.
  So Hawley Crippen, Dr Drippen, who was
  uh I would say, not really a doctor.
  Because he was like
  I have medicine training blah blah blah,
  but what he did actually was more like
  selling snake oil. He was a doctor of
  homeopathy.
  Yeah also known as doctor of bullshit.
  Yeah. Apologies to anybody who finds
  homeopathy effective,
  but you are victim to placebo.
  I thought you were gonna say who sells
  snake oil,
  but you... Then another
  friend, who was a personal friend of
  scotland yard superintendent Frank
  Forrest,
  asked them to look into the fact of
  Belle Elmore or Cora Crippen, or the other name that i'm not
  gonna try to pronounce again. They asked
  to look into the fact,
  because his secretary
  Ethel was seen wearing Cora's
  jewelry and furs.
  So they thought that if she had, as
  Hawley Crippen said, gone to america
  then she would have probably brought her
  jewelry and furs. So they... I suppose it
  depends on
  how much of an emergency she was in. If
  you're packing
  for general life relocation,
  then yeah, sure, fine, take everything. If
  you're packing for safety of your own
  life,
  not sure you'd pick your jewelry to be
  your most essential items.
  Yeah, but I think her friends didn't find
  it
  plausible because of the fact that he
  said that she was going to look at
  some property because of a family
  situation, and they were like what.
  He put out a statement saying that she
  would
  had fallen ill in california,
  and then he also said that
  she had died in california, and was
  cremated in california because of
  natural circumstances which is um
  question mark. So the house was searched,
  the house in hilldrop crescent, was
  searched
  four times by chief inspector
  walter drew, and then dr crippen
  admitted that he had fabricated the
  story about his wife.
  I think we should distinguish that
  the first search happened while he was
  still in london,
  and everything was found to be okay,
  and then he didn't realize
  that the police were
  fine with the initial search so he
  fled to belgium.
  I'm getting to it. No but when he fled to
  belgium,
  is when they conducted the extra three
  searches.
  Okay. So i think it's important to say
  that after the first search
  he ran away and it was his
  disappearance that led to the extra
  searches.
  Okay so the first search was conducted
  and doctor (in air quotes) Crippen
  admitted that he had fabricated the
  story of his wife having
  died, and explained that she had
  run away to america with one of her
  lovers,
  a music hall actor named bruce
  miller. They left, the police left,
  and they fled to brussels
  and then boarded a canadian
  pacific liner called the ss montrose for
  canada. So after that, the scotland yard
  performed, as you said, another three
  searches of the house. Of the house. 
  They said that during the fourth and
  final search
  they pried up the floorboarding,
  and found a torso of a human body
  buried under the floorboarding.
  During an autopsy of this
  torso, a senior scientific analysist
  found traces of the drug called
  scopolamine
  in the torso parts, and they also said
  that
  her scarring from a surgical,
  wait... She had an ovariectomy.
  What does that mean? A removal of an
  ovary.
  Yeah, so she couldn't have children and
  the ovariectomy was like, they said that
  the scar
  on the torso that they found underneath
  the floorboards,
  was identified as Cora
  because of that scar. Some people
  said that the scar had hair
  follicles, which would mean that it's not
  a scar I guess? Does that make sense?
  Yeah so scar tissue doesn't have
  the capability of producing
  follicles or sebaceous glands or
  anything like that.
  So the later revival
  of the forensic evidence on that scar
  led to question marks about
  how it could be used in
  the conviction of hawley they said that
  they
  just found the torso, not the heads, not
  the limbs
  because dr cripple
  (in air quotes) tried to dissolve
  her remains in in quick lime. Yeah.
  Yeah but accidentally preserved it.
  Yeah so quicklime is
  commonly used as a substance
  to decompose a body and so it's quite
  possible
  that the limbs and head
  were successfully decomposed, however
  I think there was a leak of some sort
  under the flooring, which uh, when
  quicklime is exposed to water it actually
  acts as a preservative. So I think
  probably her torso ended up being
  preserved,
  while the quick lime served its function
  with the rest of her body.
  Yeah so Crippen and
  le Neave were crossing the atlantic
  on the montrose, and captain henry george
  kendall recognized the fugitives
  and said that he recognized
  dr cripple and said that he had taken
  off his mustache
  and had grown a beard and his companion
  on the trip that was disguised
  as a boy was mannered
  and built undoubtedly like a girl
  was captain kendall's telegram
  so he had sent that telegram
  i think before they departed it was
  before they reached
  canada they'd already departed yeah
  and drew from the police
  boarded a faster ship and
  arrived in canada before
  crippen and lenev ethel
  i think it's quite funny to mention
  a couple of factors in their
  transatlantic journey
  one of them is that they'd opted
  to go to canada which at the time was
  still part of the british empire
  which meant that the telegram going to
  the british police
  was still under commonwealth
  jurisdiction
  when they got to canada
  so they were still under the law of
  the uk when they landed whereas if
  they'd chosen
  to depart at a u.s
  destination they would have been subject
  to
  extradition which would have elongated
  the whole process
  and would have needed the approval of
  the united states so they probably
  would have been able to get off if
  they'd gone
  to the united states rather than canada
  yeah and secondly harvey crippen was an
  american citizen
  yeah and second of all because
  of dr crippen's self-esteem
  and high opinion of himself he traveled
  in first class and
  if he had actually traveled in a lower
  class
  he probably would have evaded the
  attention of the captain
  so because he was in and around the
  upper echelons
  of the classes of that bow that's what
  gave the captain the opportunity to
  recognize him and send that telegraph
  back
  whereas if he'd traveled under a lower
  class
  second or third then he would have been
  lower down in the ship
  and the captain probably wouldn't have
  seen him
  at all and been able to identify him so
  there's a couple of opportunities that
  he could have got away with if it
  weren't for
  his arrogance and uh
  high self-esteem which i found quite
  amusing
  which is funny that you would mention
  that because
  belle elmore or korra was
  described as an overbearing and
  domineering
  personality he was called like meek
  and diminutive just because he's quiet
  doesn't mean that he's nice which is a
  very common misconception to me true
  story bro
  yeah his first wife died of a
  air quotes heart attack but they
  aren't sure that she actually died of a
  heart attack
  because he might have killed her too it
  was very funny
  i thought that chief inspector dew from
  the scotland yard
  boarded the ship
  and they invited crippen
  to meet the pilots and then do removed
  his pilot's cap and said good morning dr
  crippen do you know me
  i'm chief inspector dew from the
  scotland yard
  and then after pause krippen said thank
  god it's
  over that suspense has been too
  great i couldn't stand it any longer and
  i thought that that was just
  so funny because it sounded like
  dialogue
  from like agatha christie you need to
  count more
  [Laughter]
  and then crippen and lenev
  or ethel were arrested on board the
  montrose on the 31st of july
  1910. krippen was returned to england
  on another ship i just wanted to say
  like the trial
  mentioned as we spoke about before that
  the
  scarification of the torso
  that they said had hair growth on it
  which would say that maybe it wasn't a
  scarf
  or it wasn't her scarf from the what is
  it called what did i say
  the thing over ectomy yeah the
  ovarectomy
  and they also said that toxic compound
  hyoscene
  hyacine were found in the remains
  do you know what how your scene is yeah
  so
  uh hyacine is typically used as a
  treatment for
  motion sickness or nausea
  typically present in first trimester
  pregnancy and it was shown
  that hawley had actually
  taken out an order for hyacine
  i don't know whether it was prescription
  at that time or whether he just
  bought some but uh pharmacy records show
  that he had
  purchased it within the applicable time
  frame of korra dying
  they did find toxic levels in the torso
  they recovered yeah and they also said
  that the torso was wrapped in a pajama
  top
  or had epidemic fragment on it
  that was not sold prior to
  1908 yes so in in his
  trial the prosecution
  argued that because they found this
  franklin
  of his pajama top which had been
  established
  that corey had given him as a gift that
  indicated that he was involved in the
  crime
  now his defense said that
  prior to 1908 there had been another
  family
  that had lived in the house and it was
  perfectly possible
  that the crime of the body
  was committed by them and that could
  explain the presence of the pajama top
  so the prosecution got in contact with
  the manufacturer
  who stated that it wasn't available for
  sale
  before 1908 which basically ruled out
  the defense's
  argument that it was the other family
  because that was
  three years before the production
  of this particular pyjama set
  and then crippen was found guilty
  and then hanged at the pentonville
  prison on wednesday the 23rd of november
  1910 and after
  that which is where i found
  well i kind of found this whole case
  interesting because of the fact that it
  all
  seems to be like a plot from a
  gotha christie novel or something like
  that
  because of the chase and the
  lines and everything iconic i would say
  but nowadays people
  think that he might have been innocent
  because of the evidence
  from dr david ferran
  in october 2007
  did you read about that there's been a
  lot of
  attempts to retrial due to the evidence
  one of the main ones was
  they did a mitochondrial dna
  analysis of the skin that they recovered
  and found that the mitochondrial dna
  was almost certainly belonging to a male
  which would rule out the fact that it
  was cora's
  body but also this evidence has been
  refuted
  by a couple of different sources for a
  couple of
  different reasons one of the reasons
  being that the technique that was used
  to interpret the dna isn't
  a widely accepted scientific
  method for mitochondrial
  dna analysis is performed by one lab
  in the world and the second
  is that the only reference that they've
  got
  is a sample of tissue that's over a
  hundred years old
  so given that they were testing it in
  the early 2000s
  and the sample itself is from the early
  1900s
  although mitochondrial dna has got a
  longer
  life than nucleic dna
  it's still not really a suitable source
  of evidence
  to be able to use this kind of dna
  manipulation to be able to determine
  whether it's a match or not now the lab
  that performs
  the dna analysis have said that it was
  almost irrefutable that
  the evidence that they came up with
  was linked to a male's dna
  but you only need to have a little bit
  of experience in dna analysis to know
  that a sample that's over a hundred
  years old
  isn't going to give you the best results
  so there's a little bit of question
  marks
  as to whether this technique is actually
  suitable
  to be able to say that the
  sample isn't a match i
  understand why people are like oh but
  the dna
  evidence say that it's a male
  because of the fact that dna
  sounds so inherently
  much better than like oh this scar
  yeah so when they convicted at the time
  the only real evidence that they had
  was that they recovered some scar tissue
  and that matched cora's medical records
  which if you convert that into a case
  today probably wouldn't stand they also
  said that they had
  found the drug yes
  so we can we can get onto that into a
  little bit but if we talk about
  the scar tissue yeah it's perfectly
  possible
  for other women to have the same
  scar tissue that's not individual
  evidence at all mitochondrial
  dna is slightly different to nucleic dna
  in that it is almost identically
  passed down through the maternal line
  so your maternal
  dna mitochondrial dna will be
  exactly the same as your mom's
  mitochondrial dna
  there's no split between
  the mother and the father like there is
  with nucleic dna
  it's really easy with modern techniques
  to find a link along
  the maternal line so they track down
  a couple of korra's great granddaughters
  and took a sample from them yeah
  sorry yeah grand nieces who would have
  the same mitochondrial dna
  that mitochondrial dna according to this
  one
  lab didn't match what they
  recovered from the scar tissue
  which is what they used to determine
  the dna link because that was presented
  in court just yes yes yeah
  the biggest problem with that is that
  any kind of dna evidence will degrade
  over time
  so given that the sample is over 100
  years old
  and that the more that we progress with
  dna evidence the more that we know what
  kind of conditions it needs to be stored
  under
  the amount of mitochondrial dna that
  they could have
  possibly recovered from the scar tissue
  is so
  negligible that they would have had to
  amplify it
  so many times that that introduces a
  possibility of
  error which is where people are arguing
  that it's not entirely reliable
  source of scientific evidence
  so it might have been the person doing
  the autopsies dna
  not necessarily that but the dna would
  have degraded to such an extent
  that you wouldn't be able to amplify it
  enough
  to give a 100 assurance that this
  amplified dna
  is 100 a replicant of
  the original sample tissue
  just looking at the behavior
  from him being like okay i'm gonna
  flee the country with my
  lover ethel and him they had a
  relationship
  during the time that he was married
  to korra feels like
  why would he flee the country if he was
  not
  guilty of the murder yeah a lot of the
  circumstantial evidence is quite
  suspicious
  but also i read in one article that she
  had one month
  earlier said to him that she was gonna
  leave him
  and that she was gonna take the money
  out of
  her account that kind of sounds like
  she might have been murdered to me
  because if she would take
  the steps to withdraw
  her finances from her account
  then she would have probably brought her
  jewelry
  her first which was probably worth more
  than
  most people owned at that time
  because in that time the only
  possessions
  that you had were like
  land or property
  or jewelry or first because selling that
  on
  would have given her a lot of money and
  because
  his girlfriend at the time
  was wearing her jewelry and her furs
  i'm like um because she was going
  through the trouble of withdrawing her
  money and stuff she would have brought
  her jewelry you just thought so yeah
  yeah that's what i think so what do you
  think do you think he's
  guilty or innocent i think he's guilty
  yeah me too mostly because of the
  circumstantial evidence which
  is again not enough to
  sentence someone but why would he
  flee the country if he was
  innocent also a person who sells snake
  oil
  always suspicious yeah
  what are you gonna do now um
  furiously masturbate of course to
  volcano
  volcano yeah like that
  i just thought that it was funny that
  she was called volcano the strong woman
  i was like oh yeah
  it's just like a volcano
  you want to say goodbye to the listeners
  [Music]
  bye listeners love you russian boss

Dr (in air quotes) Hawley Harvey Crippen, who was put on trial for murdering his wife Cora Crippen (stage name Belle Elmore), is the infamous snake oil selling criminal we're discussing in this episode. Joe (the hormone monster) feels like his forensic education is under scrutiny, and Sandra reads telegrams and gets told she needs to get out more.

Sandra got her information wikipedia, as well as these articles:

#### Audio transcript 





Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content,
listener discretion is advised. He did a
very good job
in vikings, the series, he was like the
weird
magic guy and... Oh yeah
the typical character that's cast in all
of these
historical documentaries, the magic
guy. He made
boats, so not that magic I guess.
No you're a typical shipwright carpenter,
the magic guy is probably the
least
apt description for someone who makes
boats.
I think it was like, because he's
very like... Go and see the magic guy!
You need a special remedy? Oh what can he
help me with?
Well if you need to get across a small
body of water,
he's your guy.
But i've got pancreatitis. Well, you know,
maybe open water will help.
\[Music] 



Oh wait no i've got another impression.
Yeah?
I can do harry potter
impersonating aragog. What
the fuck, and also please
do it. So I assume you've seen
the films at least once? Yeah. But in
yeah, in half blood prince harry takes
the
felix felicis to get their memories
from slughorn, remember that? Yep.
So I don't know if they included it in... I
know they definitely included it in the
books. Duh
\[Laughter] So the whole point of taking the felix
felicis is to go and meet slughorn and
to get
the memories of riddle for the horcruxes.
So both in the book and the film,
harry's like you know what, I'm actually
going to go and see
hagrid. I just got a really good feeling
about this,
hagrid's gonna be great! And then on his
way
to meet hagrid he comes across slughorn
collecting tentacular leaves
for a potion and he sneaks up on him, and
I don't know if this is in the books but
it's definitely in the films,
harry acts like he's kind of drunk.
So aragog's dead and slughorn
asks to collect some of the venom
from his pincers and then harry's like,
ah yeah, but you know don't forget that
and does like a little finger motion
with his two index
fingers to imitate aragog's pincers.
And that that was my impression of harry
impersonating aragog.
Was just (clicking noise).
Because I was like, this does not
translate in a podcast.


Okay so are you ready to start the case?
You're listening to Midweek
Murders,
that means it's time to talk about crime.
I'm your host jay bear
and this is... (whispers "It's your turn").
Is Sandra!
Listen to our podcast
we're hilarious!
We talk about crime, we make some
funnies...
You sound like a character on the one
with the
puberty monster. I'm the fucking
hormone fairy! What is it called?
(sings "I'm going through changes").
What is it called? I don't remember. Me
neither.
If this makes it into the cut. Fucking
hormone fairy?!
I'm the puberty monster! Yeah
people are gonna scream at us being like
it's called this, you
morons. We've got a lot going on okay?
We have a very stressful life. You guys
need to chill the fuck out, yeah? You
listen to this for pleasure,
just chill out with the comments, okay?
We never receive any comments it would
be nice if somebody could speak to us.
We're very lonely. This is funny.
So true.
Okay you're listening to midweek murders,
I'm your host sandra. And I'm your
co-host
Joe. 

So the case we're gonna talk about
today is Hawley Harvey Crippen
and my references is:
britannica biography
about Hawley Harvey... Hawley Harvey
Hawley?! Hawley Harvey Crippen,
what a fucking joke!
Written by the editors of encyclopedia
britannica.
The oldie.co.uk, which I first thought
was a website about me.
The article it's called
mutilating the evidence, and it's a blog
by Bob Woffinden.
Bob?! Bob?! What a fucking
guy! I love Bob.
I also read... He comes from the bronx,
everybody loves Bob.
I also read about the victim
in into the limelight
dot org which is funny, because i thought
that thing was like dead in the 90s,
dot org? But it's still kicking. And
the history press.co.uk
extracted from a century of london
murders and executions,
by John J Eddleston.
You know dot org just means it's a
website for a specific
organization like,
dot co dot uk,
is a company from the uk.
And dot com is the us,
and dot d e is from
germany. Like dot org is not a thing that
only existed in the 90s,
it's still very much
a live domain for any organization
that is international. Okay,
I should have known that. I did not. You
should have known that
given you're the tech freak in this
whole dynamic.
Yeah yeah yeah in this whole dynamic.
I got my information from
wiki wiki waa, wikipedia.
Didn't you research evidence that said
he was
innocent? I already
know about mitochondrial dna from my
forensics
training, so if you want to reference
that,
that was from anglia ruskin university
2010 until 2013.
You're welcome. Okay
oh god, I have a forensic science
bsc
honorary degree 2.1, does anybody
need
my personal bank details?
Don't do that we'll already given them...
Never
felt so much under scrutiny
than i have right now for my fucking
forensic education.
We've already given them our birthdays.
Oh, no one's gonna remember because
nobody knows that 9 11 happened in
september.


The disappearance of, and this is
strange, but there's lots and lots of
different names in here.
And this woman who was born
konigunde makamotsky,
changed her name to cora turner
in the u.s because she was living there
with her parents,
and then changed her name again
to Belle Elmore which was her stage name.
She married Hawley Crippen.
Hawley Crippen. Sorry Hawley.
No way.
What kind of bronx are you living in
chump?! Not any kind of bronx
just london england.
Ey up govna', I can do
the english! Oh yeah
she was 11 years younger than he was
when they married, and then they moved
to london england,
and moved into a house
in hilldrop crescent which is
very very close to where I live. Don't
tell them that, you fucking internet
amateur.
Very, very far away from
anybody associated with this podcast.
Yes cut that over
so that it appears really awkward.
They moved into there because they
wanted
separate bedrooms and they also had
lodgers.
And they had a party at their home
on the 31st of january 1910
where one of the guests wanted to go to
the
bathroom, and she got annoyed
at her husband because the husband
didn't
show him to the bathroom, so she was like
this is not
the proper way to treat guests. And then
when they left the party,
that was the last time anyone saw her.
And she was a very
colorful character, she was,
as I read it in the sources, not a very
good music hall performer.
She tried to be an opera singer, didn't
work out, she tried to be a vaudeville
entertainer, didn't work out. And
she once during the strike of
music hall artists she arrived to perform
at the theater and one of the protesters
that was supporting the strike was like
oh
let her in, because everyone is gonna
leave anyway.
Oh savage! So savage, yeah. 

Police first heard of
Coras disappearance
from her friend, the strong woman
Kate Williams better known as Vulcana.
And I was like, good lord let there be a
picture,
and there was a picture of strong woman
Vulcana which is so... Did she look sexy?
Oh yeah she was very strong, very strong.
Look at the source, it's a very good
picture.
So Hawley Crippen, Dr Drippen, who was
uh I would say, not really a doctor.
Because he was like
I have medicine training blah blah blah,
but what he did actually was more like
selling snake oil. He was a doctor of
homeopathy.
Yeah also known as doctor of bullshit.
Yeah. Apologies to anybody who finds
homeopathy effective,
but you are victim to placebo.
I thought you were gonna say who sells
snake oil,
but you... Then another
friend, who was a personal friend of
scotland yard superintendent Frank
Forrest,
asked them to look into the fact of
Belle Elmore or Cora Crippen, or the other name that i'm not
gonna try to pronounce again. They asked
to look into the fact,
because his secretary
Ethel was seen wearing Cora's
jewelry and furs.
So they thought that if she had, as
Hawley Crippen said, gone to america
then she would have probably brought her
jewelry and furs. So they... I suppose it
depends on
how much of an emergency she was in. If
you're packing
for general life relocation,
then yeah, sure, fine, take everything. If
you're packing for safety of your own
life,
not sure you'd pick your jewelry to be
your most essential items.
Yeah, but I think her friends didn't find
it
plausible because of the fact that he
said that she was going to look at
some property because of a family
situation, and they were like what.
He put out a statement saying that she
would
had fallen ill in california,
and then he also said that
she had died in california, and was
cremated in california because of
natural circumstances which is um
question mark. So the house was searched,
the house in hilldrop crescent, was
searched
four times by chief inspector
walter drew, and then dr crippen
admitted that he had fabricated the
story about his wife.
I think we should distinguish that
the first search happened while he was
still in london,
and everything was found to be okay,
and then he didn't realize
that the police were
fine with the initial search so he
fled to belgium.
I'm getting to it. No but when he fled to
belgium,
is when they conducted the extra three
searches.
Okay. So i think it's important to say
that after the first search
he ran away and it was his
disappearance that led to the extra
searches.


Okay so the first search was conducted
and doctor (in air quotes) Crippen
admitted that he had fabricated the
story of his wife having
died, and explained that she had
run away to america with one of her
lovers,
a music hall actor named bruce
miller. They left, the police left,
and they fled to brussels
and then boarded a canadian
pacific liner called the ss montrose for
canada. So after that, the scotland yard
performed, as you said, another three
searches of the house. Of the house. 
They said that during the fourth and
final search
they pried up the floorboarding,
and found a torso of a human body
buried under the floorboarding.
During an autopsy of this
torso, a senior scientific analysist
found traces of the drug called
scopolamine
in the torso parts, and they also said
that
her scarring from a surgical,
wait... She had an ovariectomy.
What does that mean? A removal of an
ovary.
Yeah, so she couldn't have children and
the ovariectomy was like, they said that
the scar
on the torso that they found underneath
the floorboards,
was identified as Cora
because of that scar. Some people
said that the scar had hair
follicles, which would mean that it's not
a scar I guess? Does that make sense?
Yeah so scar tissue doesn't have
the capability of producing
follicles or sebaceous glands or
anything like that.


So the later revival
of the forensic evidence on that scar
led to question marks about
how it could be used in
the conviction of hawley they said that
they
just found the torso, not the heads, not
the limbs
because dr cripple
(in air quotes) tried to dissolve
her remains in in quick lime. Yeah.
Yeah but accidentally preserved it.
Yeah so quicklime is
commonly used as a substance
to decompose a body and so it's quite
possible
that the limbs and head
were successfully decomposed, however
I think there was a leak of some sort
under the flooring, which uh, when
quicklime is exposed to water it actually
acts as a preservative. So I think
probably her torso ended up being
preserved,
while the quick lime served its function
with the rest of her body.
Yeah so Crippen and
le Neave were crossing the atlantic
on the montrose, and captain henry george
kendall recognized the fugitives
and said that he recognized
dr Crippen and said that he had taken
off his mustache
and had grown a beard and his companion
on the trip that was disguised
as a boy was mannered
and built undoubtedly like a girl
was captain kendall's telegram
so he had sent that telegram
i think before they departed it was
before they reached
canada. They'd already departed. Yeah
and drew from the police
boarded a faster ship and
arrived in canada before
crippen and le neve, Ethel.


I think it's quite funny to mention
a couple of factors in their
transatlantic journey
one of them is that they'd opted
to go to canada which at the time was
still part of the british empire
which meant that the telegram going to
the british police
was still under commonwealth
jurisdiction
when they got to canada
so they were still under the law of
the uk when they landed whereas if
they'd chosen
to depart at a u.s
destination they would have been subject
to
extradition which would have elongated
the whole process
and would have needed the approval of
the united states so they probably
would have been able to get off if
they'd gone
to the united states rather than canada
yeah and secondly harvey crippen was an
american citizen
yeah and second of all because
of dr crippen's self-esteem
and high opinion of himself he traveled
in first class and
if he had actually traveled in a lower
class
he probably would have evaded the
attention of the captain
so because he was in and around the
upper echelons
of the classes of that bow that's what
gave the captain the opportunity to
recognize him and send that telegraph
back
whereas if he'd traveled under a lower
class
second or third then he would have been
lower down in the ship
and the captain probably wouldn't have
seen him
at all and been able to identify him so
there's a couple of opportunities that
he could have got away with if it
weren't for
his arrogance and uh
high self-esteem which i found quite
amusing
which is funny that you would mention
that because
belle elmore or korra was
described as an overbearing and
domineering
personality he was called like meek
and diminutive just because he's quiet
doesn't mean that he's nice which is a
very common misconception to me true
story bro
yeah his first wife died of a
air quotes heart attack but they
aren't sure that she actually died of a
heart attack
because he might have killed her too it
was very funny
i thought that chief inspector dew from
the scotland yard
boarded the ship
and they invited crippen
to meet the pilots and then do removed
his pilot's cap and said good morning dr
crippen do you know me
i'm chief inspector dew from the
scotland yard
and then after pause krippen said thank
god it's
over that suspense has been too
great i couldn't stand it any longer and
i thought that that was just
so funny because it sounded like
dialogue
from like agatha christie you need to
count more
\[Laughter] and then crippen and lenev
or ethel were arrested on board the
montrose on the 31st of july 1910. Crippen was returned to england on another ship.

I just wanted to say
like the trial
mentioned as we spoke about before that
the
scarification of the torso
that they said had hair growth on it
which would say that maybe it wasn't a
scarf
or it wasn't her scarf from the what is
it called, what did i say?
the thing overectomy. Yeah, the
ovarectomy
and they also said that toxic compound
hyoscene
hyacine were found in the remains
do you know what how your scene is yeah
so
uh hyacine is typically used as a
treatment for
motion sickness or nausea
typically present in first trimester
pregnancy and it was shown
that hawley had actually
taken out an order for hyacine
i don't know whether it was prescription
at that time or whether he just
bought some but uh pharmacy records show
that he had
purchased it within the applicable time
frame of Cora dying
they did find toxic levels in the torso
they recovered yeah and they also said
that the torso was wrapped in a pajama
top
or had epidemic fragment on it
that was not sold prior to
1908 yes so in in his
trial the prosecution
argued that because they found this
franklin
of his pajama top which had been
established
that corey had given him as a gift that
indicated that he was involved in the
crime
now his defense said that
prior to 1908 there had been another
family
that had lived in the house and it was
perfectly possible
that the crime of the body
was committed by them and that could
explain the presence of the pajama top
so the prosecution got in contact with
the manufacturer
who stated that it wasn't available for
sale
before 1908 which basically ruled out
the defense's
argument that it was the other family
because that was
three years before the production
of this particular pyjama set
and then crippen was found guilty
and then hanged at the pentonville
prison on wednesday the 23rd of november
1910 and after
that which is where i found
well i kind of found this whole case
interesting because of the fact that it
all
seems to be like a plot from Agatha Christie novel or something like
that
because of the chase and the
lines and everything. Iconic, I would say.


but nowadays people
think that he might have been innocent
because of the evidence
from dr david ferran
in october 2007
did you read about that there's been a
lot of
attempts to retrial due to the evidence
one of the main ones was
they did a mitochondrial dna
analysis of the skin that they recovered
and found that the mitochondrial dna
was almost certainly belonging to a male
which would rule out the fact that it
was cora's
body but also this evidence has been
refuted
by a couple of different sources for a
couple of
different reasons one of the reasons
being that the technique that was used
to interpret the dna isn't
a widely accepted scientific
method for mitochondrial
dna analysis is performed by one lab
in the world and the second
is that the only reference that they've
got
is a sample of tissue that's over a
hundred years old
so given that they were testing it in
the early 2000s
and the sample itself is from the early
1900s
although mitochondrial dna has got a
longer
life than nucleic dna
it's still not really a suitable source
of evidence
to be able to use this kind of dna
manipulation to be able to determine
whether it's a match or not now the lab
that performs
the dna analysis have said that it was
almost irrefutable that
the evidence that they came up with
was linked to a male's dna
but you only need to have a little bit
of experience in dna analysis to know
that a sample that's over a hundred
years old
isn't going to give you the best results
so there's a little bit of question
marks
as to whether this technique is actually
suitable
to be able to say that the
sample isn't a match i
understand why people are like oh but
the dna
evidence say that it's a male
because of the fact that dna
sounds so inherently
much better than like oh this scar
yeah so when they convicted at the time
the only real evidence that they had
was that they recovered some scar tissue
and that matched cora's medical records
which if you convert that into a case
today probably wouldn't stand they also
said that they had
found the drug yes
so we can we can get onto that into a
little bit but if we talk about
the scar tissue yeah it's perfectly
possible
for other women to have the same
scar tissue that's not individual
evidence at all mitochondrial
dna is slightly different to nucleic dna
in that it is almost identically
passed down through the maternal line
so your maternal
dna mitochondrial dna will be
exactly the same as your mom's
mitochondrial dna
there's no split between
the mother and the father like there is
with nucleic dna
it's really easy with modern techniques
to find a link along
the maternal line so they track down
a couple of korra's great granddaughters
and took a sample from them yeah
sorry yeah grand nieces who would have
the same mitochondrial dna
that mitochondrial dna according to this
one
lab didn't match what they
recovered from the scar tissue
which is what they used to determine
the dna link because that was presented
in court just yes yes yeah
the biggest problem with that is that
any kind of dna evidence will degrade
over time
so given that the sample is over 100
years old
and that the more that we progress with
dna evidence the more that we know what
kind of conditions it needs to be stored
under
the amount of mitochondrial dna that
they could have
possibly recovered from the scar tissue
is so
negligible that they would have had to
amplify it
so many times that that introduces a
possibility of
error which is where people are arguing
that it's not entirely reliable
source of scientific evidence
so it might have been the person doing
the autopsies dna
not necessarily that but the dna would
have degraded to such an extent
that you wouldn't be able to amplify it
enough
to give a 100 assurance that this
amplified dna
is 100 a replicant of
the original sample tissue.


Just looking at the behavior
from him being like okay i'm gonna
flee the country with my
lover ethel and him they had a
relationship
during the time that he was married
to Cora feels like
why would he flee the country if he was
not
guilty of the murder yeah a lot of the
circumstantial evidence is quite
suspicious.
but also i read in one article that she
had one month
earlier said to him that she was gonna
leave him
and that she was gonna take the money
out of
her account that kind of sounds like
she might have been murdered to me
because if she would take
the steps to withdraw
her finances from her account
then she would have probably brought her
jewelry
her first which was probably worth more
than
most people owned at that time
because in that time the only
possessions
that you had were like
land or property
or jewelry or first because selling that
on
would have given her a lot of money and
because
his girlfriend at the time
was wearing her jewelry and her furs
i'm like um because she was going
through the trouble of withdrawing her
money and stuff she would have brought
her jewelry you just thought so yeah
yeah that's what i think so what do you
think do you think he's
guilty or innocent i think he's guilty
yeah me too mostly because of the
circumstantial evidence which
is again not enough to
sentence someone but why would he
flee the country if he was
innocent also a person who sells snake
oil
always suspicious yeah.


what are you gonna do now?
furiously masturbate of course to
volcana
volcana yeah like that
i just thought that it was funny that
she was called volcano the strong woman
i was like oh yeah
it's just like a volcano
you want to say goodbye to the listeners
\[Music] bye listeners love you russian boss
bye bye see you next week thank you so
much for listening
to midweek murders
ciao ciao motherfuckers
