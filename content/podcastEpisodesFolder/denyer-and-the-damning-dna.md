#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

Okay, now I am recording. 

Which means that it's time to open with a song.

That's usually not in the episode.

> Teenagers scare the living shit out of me\
> They could care less as long as someone'll bleed\
> So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\
> Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me \[Joe sings]

Is that why you always sing in the beginning of the episodes? Because you're trying to start a singing career?

No, you have to be able to sing to make a career out of it. \[Laughter]

I didn't want to say it, but... \[Laughter] If I was born as a man in the 1800s, I would probably be a composer rather than a player. I've always been more of a big picture kind of gal.

Nobody would have listened to you, because you had a wandering womb. \[Laughter]

I said "if I was a man"! 

Oh.

That does make things different, doesn't it? 

Oh yeah, then you'd have been a genius. 

Or a farmer, depending on who birthed me. \[Laughter]

Genius or peasant, luck of the draw.

True story though, isn't it? 

I mean, I feel like that's modern day Sweden.

\[Music]



So it's Wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra.

And I'm your host Joe!

This week we're going to talk about the murders of Elizabeth Stevens, Deborah Fream, and Natalie Russell, as well as the attack on Rosza Toth. I got my information from wikipedia, crimelibrary.com by Paul B. Kidd, and an article in now to love by "as told to take five". Hmm. I couldn't get the name, it was just "by as told to take five", I was like: "alright". Blog post on crime in my pocket. That's my sources. Are they reputable? Maybe not. 

"Those are my sources and I'm sticking with them". \[Laughter]

Ain't that the truth! 

I got mine from the wiki wiki wah, and a tv series called forensic investigations: the Paul Denyer episode. Yeah, I actually watched something. It was intriguing.

Okay. In Frankston, a suburb of Melbourne Australia, in February 1993, Donna Vanes' Claude arrived home with her fiance at approximately 11 p.m to a horrific scene. Trigger warning - animal cruelty. Someone had murdered her cats, and used their blood to write a message on the wall stating: "Donna - you're dead". Understandably freaked out, Donna didn't want to stay another night in her flat and moved in with her sister Tricia. Tricia's neighbor, Denyer, told Donna that she: "was safe now", and that Denyer would personally take care of the person who was responsible for the break-in if the police ever found out who it was.

Spooky. 

Red flags! In June the same year, Elizabeth Stevens was found murdered in a park, a short drive away from Frankston. She had been reported missing the day before by her aunt and uncle, who she was staying with whilst studying at the nearby TAFE Frankston. Which, I don't know if it's a University, but it's like a kind of university I think? 

Yeah. I don't know what their education system is in Australia, it's probably like a college or something. 

Probably, yeah. Police made an effort in trying to find her killer by interviewing the bus driver and passengers on her last known bus drive, as well as looking into every library in the area, and knocking on doors of the residents, but nobody could tell them anything. 

So Elizabeth Stevens, the first victim, they couldn't set up the crime scene immediately because of the poor weather. So they had to do it the next day, and that's why there was no forensic evidence found, it all been washed away by the poor weather. They did find that there were a couple of small tree branches that had been placed over her body. The reason for this I don't understand, because there wasn't enough foliage to conceal her body. Her body was still visible, but he'd now given himself an MO to link him to the other murders. On the slightly less macabre side, which I feel like is worth mentioning, they did find that all of her lower body clothing was intact. So at least we're not looking at an opportunist rapist. I say "at least" like we're not covering the case of a serial murderer.

This is a comedy podcast, guys! \[Laughter]

So when they looked at the body post mortem, they found that the cause of death was strangulation. She was also stabbed multiple times and had her throat slashed, but those both occurred after she had died. They know that she was strangled because of a thing called petechial hemorrhages, little pin prick hemorrhages in their eyes. There were minor injuries to her body that indicated that she was moved post-mortem, so after she had died, nearby to where she was found. They found her school bag with lots of her school books that had her name in them, so they were able to identify her by that, and then obviously did the DNA and forensics testing to confirm that afterwards. 

Okay. On the 8th of July, Rosza Toth, a 41 year old bank clerk, had finished work and was heading home when she was accosted by a person who tried to drag her into a nearby nature reserve. She fought for her life, biting the assailant's fingers down to the bone, and she eventually managed to flee and successfully flagged down a passing car. She immediately called the police, and the police came to the crime scene within minutes but couldn't find any trace of the attacker. And here I have a question: if you bite someone that hard, wouldn't you have DNA in your teeth?

Only if you've got skin. If it was a completely clean bite, then probably not. 

That's true. 

Obviously, something that strong is gonna draw blood, but that's not gonna last very long in your mouth. So unless she's got some form of tissue in her teeth, this is probably not gonna give any kind of useful evidence. But it's gonna cause a whole world of pain, so bite your assailant anyway.

Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Later on the same day, 22 year old Debbie Fream went missing when she drove to her local shop to buy some milk. Four days after she went missing, her body was found by a farmer in one of his paddocks. The attack on Rosza, which had first been considered as a robbery gone wrong, was now suspected to be linked to the murders of Elizabeth and Debbie. The police realized that there was a perpetrator on the loose in Frankston attacking women at random. And here they did a weird thing, and they put up like a phone line for women in Frankston, and stuff like that, and told them to stay at home. You can't protect women by telling them to stay home. People were like: "oh, the police did such a great job by telling women to stay at home", I was like: "no". 

In the forensic investigation program they did some interviews with like general citizens. People were like: "yeah, we don't feel safe walking down the street". And then there was one bloke who was like: "yeah, we go clubbing quite a lot, but it's got really bad now because there's no women there". I think you might have missed the point of why they're questioning you, my friend. "Yeah, I used to go clubbing a lot, but I've stopped now because there's no people to creep on". \[Laughter] So like you said, Deborah went to the shop to get some milk. She was a new mother, so the police's first thought was that perhaps she was experiencing some kind of postpartum depression, and might have run away from home or done something to herself because of that. But when they spoke to her husband, and friends and family, she was reportedly overjoyed about having a baby and she was really enjoying life. So they pretty quickly ruled out the postpartum theory.

Yeah. Which is a hormonal thing. 

Yeah, it's completely normal. I think a lot of women go through postpartum, not uncommon at all. When they found her body four days after she was reported missing, she was found with very similar injuries to that of Elizabeth Stevens. So she was stabbed, her throat was slashed, and she had the crisscross markings on her chest. They also managed to eventually find her car, and they noted pretty quickly that there was a v-shaped dent on the front of her car that passed from the bonnet, or the hood, all the way down the radiator grille and onto the number plate, or the license plate. So they were pretty confident that that vehicle had been crashed into some kind of vertical object, whether that be a sign post or a wall, the vehicle had collided with something to cause that dent. When they looked a little bit closer at it, they found that the number plate had a strange orange debris on it. So they tested that forensically...

Oh! Was it Trump? Or cheetos? Just spitballing here. \[Laughter]

It wasn't Trump or cheetos. So they looked at that with a technique that lets you know the elemental composition of what you're looking at, and found that it was brick. So the car had crashed into a brick wall, and most likely the corner of a brick wall, which is why it was a v-shape rather than flat crumple across the whole of the bonnet slash hood. There was eyewitness reports to say that a car matching the description of Debbie's car was seen driving erratically around the area, and flashing their high beams. There was nothing at the scene, where they recovered Debbie's body, forensically to be able to link it to a suspect. Again the body was covered with small tree branches. So again, MO linking back to Elizabeth. Again, like Elizabeth, the underwear was intact. So we know that this wasn't a sexually motivated attack, and during the post-mortem there were no vaginal injuries. So they did the whole forensic spiel on the car, and found that the driver's seat was all the way back. Now Debbie was not the tallest person in the world, so this indicated to the officers investigating that somebody of a taller stature had driven the car after Debbie had. They also found a blade of grass that was covered in blood on the passenger seat. 

One?! 

Yeah.

That's fucking crazy. 

Yeah, they found one blade of grass. They also found blood on the driver's seat, and this was a match to Debbie. So they know that she was injured in the car, and unfortunately it wasn't a link to the suspect. But at least it gives that kind of time frame, as to what was happening and when it was happening.

On the afternoon of the 30th of July, 17 year old Natalie Russell was on her way back home from John Paul college, on her bike, when she was attacked and murdered. Her body was discovered a mere eight hours later in some bushes beside the bike track. But this time the police managed to find a clue as to whom the murder was. I just wrote Joe here, because there were...

That's me! \[Laughter]

Yeah. Because there was evidence by Natalie Russell.

Yes there was. 

And what was it?

Well it's interesting that you should mention that, because I made absolutely no notes. Jk, I made loads. \[Laughter]

I was like: "oh no", because I wrote my notes a week ago and I can't fucking remember what it was! \[Laughter]

Sorry, I'm tickled by my own joke. So the bike path that you mentioned, was a regular shortcut that a lot of people that went to the same school as Natalie took to get from school to their houses. Otherwise they would have had to walk a long way through two golf courses... there was a golf course on either side of the pathway. 

Oh my god, is Trump there as well?

Probably. Probably owns them. That pathway was lined by two wire fences, and the wire fence the police found had three holes cut into it. In one of those holes, near where the body was found, they saw that there were bloody handprints on the stanchion that holds the fence up.

Okay. 

So that could have belonged to either Natalie or the suspect, because they didn't know who it was at the time. Near the head of Natalie, they also found two thin leather straps that the scene of crime officer thought would belong to some kind of neck bound device. Whether that be like binoculars, or a pouch to keep your money in, or whatever, but something that had a leather strap that would connect it around your neck and dangle in front of you. These leather straps will also stained with blood. They also found a piece of skin. Very interesting. I noted down the dimensions, it's 2.7 by 0.5 centimeters. So a long, thin, stretch of skin. Delicious. When they examined this, they saw that it had ridges on it, which indicates that it came from a hand. The only place that you have ridges on your skin is on your fingers. 

Really? 

Ridges being one of the things that they look for in fingerprint identification.

Oh. I thought that the bottom of your feet also had ridges.

Hold on, I've got bare feet, let me have a look. Yeah, it does. But if you've got 2.7 centimeter long toes, you're a freak.

Okay. \[Laughter] Good to know.

Yeah. So when they examined the body of Natalie, they saw quite quickly that there was no correlating wound on her hands that would attribute the piece of skin that they found. So already, they know that that piece of skin belongs to their suspect. So they've got DNA that links their suspect to the crime scene of Natalie Russell's murder. 

Oh! 

Yeah, yeah. I think that is all I have on Natalie Russell. 

There was a license plate clue? 

Yes. So when Natalie went missing, there was a postal worker that was covering a route that also coincided with the start of the path that she had disappeared on, or that she was found near. As that postal worker was doing their deliveries, they noticed a yellow Toyota parked opposite the track where Natalie had disappeared. And I think they were on some kind of motorized scooter, or some kind of motorized device that wasn't a car, because they were on the path.

a motorized scooter is such

an english way how would you describe it

i don't know a motorbike she wasn't on a

motorbike

i don't mean natalie it was the post

yeah the post

no the postal worker wasn't on a

motorbike she must have been

on like a low-powered mobility scooter

or like something like that to be able

to

be on the path otherwise she would have

had to have been on the road

so it was like a motorized scooter but

i don't know what her exact vehicle was

so i said motorized scooter

okay it might have been a bicycle with

the little

electric engine that helps them go

uphill okay

i don't know i just don't know

she was in some kind of motorized

assistant

vehicle okay that was low power enough

to be on the path

but not high power enough to be on the

road

how do we know that it's not a bike

i don't know it wasn't a bike

for some reason there was some kind of

motor injury

okay i don't know why i'm getting so

yeah why are you sticking on this point

this is an

important point

anyway she scooted past

a yellow toyota that was parked opposite

the track

where natalie was found as

she scooted past electrically

or manpowered remains to be determined

she noticed that the car didn't have any

number plates either on the back

or the front oh i thought there was a

number plate

bear with so there were no license

plates

on the car where you would expect

license plates

to be oh my god i didn't know that

and when she scooted past

power undetermined

she noticed the person in the driver's

seat

slouched down in the seat

as if to try and be unobserved

definitely suspicious yeah exactly

so she was like hold on one australia

minute

this jingles my bales i don't know why

she's southern american rather than

australian

it's like the buffalo all over again

i don't know why the buffalo is scottish

put a shrimp on the barbie this guy's

suspicious

\[Music]

that's the only thing we know that is

australian although i have australian

friends

i'm sorry hayley

christmas in the sunshine what is this

world

she moved to england thinking that she

would be fine

with like a windbreaker and some

fleece leggings

oh hayley you are gonna be freezing your

tits off in this weather

and she's like queensland says \[ __ ]

warm

i was like should i go visit you she's

like no

you're gonna boil

which is probably you thing that she

says to keep me from visiting

ah no we were good friends

she probably means in the best way i'm

hoping

haley if you're there

i still want to be your friend

i love shrimp barbecued

i love fosters it's the best i love

shrimp although i don't

the big fosters it's piss water no i

don't

love fosters obviously but i do

love shrimp but i don't like the big

ones because they're really bad for the

empire

also uh fun fact about fosters

australian company

brewed in the uk i don't nobody who

drinks fosters

in the uk loads of people drink fosters

in the uk

oh maybe i'm just not that peasant

\[Music]

yeah we're irish hop house kind of

people

anyway the postal worker obviously

flagged that this was suspicious

very astute so as soon as

the postal worker got to a house where

they knew

someone was in they called the police

that's incredible

yeah so good job you postal worker the

police came out

the person in the car had disappeared

but the car was still

there they also noted that there were no

obvious license plates on the car

however

they did notice that there was a

temporary

license plate registration label

in the windscreen so they took a note of

this

wrote it down knocked on a couple of the

local doors

nobody had any more information about

the vehicle so

they took as much detail as they could

and

left the scene once natalie's

body was recovered those two

junior officers came forward and said

look we were called out to this location

yesterday the day before natalie was

found

found this strange vehicle due on these

details run these details

so they ran the details and found that

the

vehicle was registered to a tenure

\[Music]

sometime between debbie's body being

discovered and

natalie's body being discovered the

police

engaged with a criminal profiler

so the profiler looked through

all of the case history and all of the

information

available to them they found that most

serial killers were between the age of

18 and 24

so that was the age range that they were

looking for most

serial killers lead a very rich

fantasy life so they're quite often

involved with fantasizing about their

next victim

or things that they can do to their

victims

all of that kind of morbid stuff and

because of that

the profiler theorized that this person

was likely

unemployed because of the amount of time

that they would spend fantasizing about

their victims

they wouldn't be able to hold down a

regular job

so either they were doing part-time

menial work that didn't involve

much thought or they were unemployed

and speaking which or did you have more

i have one more point

but are you going to talk about how you

would also fit the profile of serial

killer

that is true

and the last point was that they were

likely going to be a local resident

so the profiler thought that given that

they

knew the back road that natalie took

and that both elizabeth and debbie were

found

very close together that the suspect was

likely a local so they painted a picture

that gave the police a little bit more

help

in being able to identify who the

suspect

might be so tenure had

tried to become a police officer had a

history of

animal cruelty and assaulted a fellow

student at school

tenure was also fired from a job at a

supermarket for deliberately trying to

knock a woman

and the child over with a row of

shopping carts

oh we all do that get frustrated in

waitrose

you're like oh why is this person in

here they're clearly not upper class

oh look at the shoes they're wearing

off throw a trolley at them the police

went to 10 years home

and left the card requesting to be

contacted

as soon as the residents returned home

sharon johnson danier's girlfriend got

in touch with them

and they told her that it was a routine

inquiry

and that they were interviewing everyone

in the district

to keep suspicions low i guess

well also it wasn't that much of a

stretch

they were investigating all of the local

area

so when they arrived at the home

tenure answered the door and commented

that there were a lot of police there

for a routine inquiry

but cheerily let them in the detectives

noticed that danier's hands were caught

in

several places

suspicious tenure was taken in and then

interrogated for hours yeah so they

asked

tenure their age and they confirmed that

they were 21

and if you remember the profiler said

that they would be between 18 and 24

they also asked denier if they were

employed

unemployed between jobs and they replied

that they were

unemployed again a tick for the profiler

like you said the police officers noted

that denier had

cuts and abrasions on their hands

when this was questioned by the

investigating officer

denier had excuses for all

of their injuries they claimed it was

from

the engine fan while they were plunging

into the depths of automotive

engineering

was it a motorized scooter no i'm just

kidding

no it was a combustion

engine powering a vehicle

the police also while daniel was in

custody

investigated the house and the car and

seized a number of knives and tools

from the home and also

a pair of binoculars

with no leather strap

they were like this is uh digging my

ding-a-ling

ding ding ding ding ding ding

ding ding so when they questioned daniel

a little bit deeper about their

movements

regarding the days that elizabeth

stephens

deborah freeman and natalie russell all

went missing

they had answers for every single

hour of each of those three days

now to an investigating officer that in

itself is suspicious

if you're able to recount every single

hour of a day that happened two weeks

ago

you've covered your tracks too

thoroughly and

then you become suspicious so that

raised the flag for the investigating

officers and they were like okay this is

a bit weird we need to go a bit deeper

so then they asked for dna samples

now at this stage i really enjoyed

the investigating officer's technique so

then you're sitting across the desk

there's two police officers interviewing

they

explain that they need the dna samples

because they've got dna from the crime

scene

and they need to be able to either link

or rule out denia so in denia's mind

they're thinking \[ __ ] i did this

they've got my dna from the crime scene

and now they need to link it to me and

the only way they can do that is through

a blood sample

or a dna swab i'm \[ __ ]

so at this stage the investigating

officer

says do you want a coffee and dania's

like yeah i could go for a coffee

yeah oh how'd you take your coffee bruv

then he was like why with two

investigating officers like yeah i could

do that

no worries i'll get your coffee i'll be

back in five minutes

he leaves the room now daniel is left

with the non-senior investigating

officer

knowing that they're \[ __ ]

q confession so while the senior

investigating officers out brewing this

delicious cup of steamy joe

that's what i like to call myself

dania is in their \[ __ ] bricks

they've got me

they \[ __ ] know i've murdered a bunch

of people

how do i don't know why i'm doing it in

cockney i've murdered

a bunch of people i'm absolutely \[ __ ]

they've got everything they need to

prosecute me

i might as well come clean i'm just

gonna do it

there's no way that i'm gonna get shrimp

on the barbie

anytime soon the last fosters i had was

last night i really \[ __ ] enjoyed it

but it's gonna be the last one i have

because i'm gonna spend the rest of my

life in bars

and not the good kind of bars the bars

that hold you in place

yep so daniel confessed everything and

then when the senior guy came back in

with his lovely cup of steamy joe hello

ladies

daniel was like yeah i've confessed and

once he had confessed

i've got a couple of quotes

from the video of their interview

that just sums up dania's psychological

position

so when they were talking about

elizabeth

the investigating officer asked why they

did it to which they replied

i just had the feeling i just

wanted to kill they moved on

to debbie and asked why

they chose debbie at that time and they

said

they just got that go feeling

and then when they uh got to questioning

about natalie

denyer said i've always wanted to kill

the timing behind it was because the

levels were quote boiling up

and then a little bit later in the

interview process

they said i've been stalking women for a

few years

just waiting for that opportunity

waiting for the sign

which is extremely creepy

\[Music]

so then you confirmed that the attacks

and murders had been

completely random and pleaded guilty to

three murders and one abduction at the

trial

and was sentenced on the 20th

of december 1993

to three consecutive sentences

of life imprisonment with no parole

period

after an appeal though daniel was

granted a

fixed no april period of 30 years

until 2023 so that's

two years from now so debbie freem's

son told the media that when daniel

applies

for parole i'll be at the hearing to

remind the authorities about the life

sentence given to

a 12 day old baby

and his dear mother and that was really

\[ __ ]

sad to read \[ __ ] you dania

yeah definitely yeah that's the case

what am i gonna do next week probably

edit and then

feel bad or

feel bad and then edit maybe that one

only time will tell okay

so thank you so much for listening to

midweek murders

we'll see see you next time

Okay, bye-bye! 

Bye.

\[Music]
