#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

What is a haberdashery?

A shop that sells haberdashers? \[Laughter] I think it's like a sewing thing.

Oh. Maybe, yeah. I just realized I was gonna say haberdashery, and then I was like: "what even is that, I don't remember". I think I knew at some point.

I don't think that would fit in any context of any conversation we were having.

I think the word stuck in my subconscious because it's just such a great word, isn't it? Who doesn't love a haberdashery. I wonder if you could say that when you're drunk, like: "no, I wasn't drunk, I was just a tad haberdashed". No, doesn't work. Well, might work if you deliver it with some gumption. 

See now that's a better word.

The english language is full of very ridiculous, funny words. And also very ridiculous, funny places, like words for places, town names and such.

Like Flitwick. 

Oh is that a place? I only knew it as a professor. Oh Professor Flitwick, you can flick my wit any time.

No see, that doesn't work because it's "flit". So you've just fucked up your own joke there, haven't you. \[Laughter]

No, you fucked it up! I delivered it with some gumption, it could have worked.

\[Music]

Okay. It's Wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra. 

And I'm your host Joe. 

Today we're going to talk about the Dyatlov Pass incident. I'm so excited, I'm so excited. 

Have you been practicing your Russian pronunciation? 

It's gonna be a struggle, we both know that. I got my information from wikipedia, BBC News, Stuff You Should Know - the episode that's called The Dyatlov Pass Mystery, and the Ermak travel guide - which had some of the photos that I was looking for. I also read loads of other sources about this, during my years of obsession with it. Okay, I'm finished. What are your sources?

Wikipedia and National Geographic.

Yeah! That's how we do it here.

And that is it. 

That is it, yeah. Okay. So nine russian youngsters, and one 38 year old, were going on a camping trip across the mountain range called the Urals. They were very experienced in hiking and trekking, and this was not their first rodeo, or outdoorseo. \[Laughter]

\[Joe sighs]

It's gonna be a long episode! To put this in perspective, all 10 of the group's members had a grade 2 hiking certification. And they would also receive a grade 3, the highest certification available, after finishing this trip. They were all studying at the Ural Polytechnic Institute at the time, except for the 38 year old I think, and the leader of the group was a 23 year old radio engineering student named Igor Dyatlov. So the other members of the group were... Oh god... Lyudmila, Alexander, Zinaida, Rustem, Nikolai, Semyon, and three guys named Yuri. Which is a crazy amount of Yuris.

Would it not be easier to refer to them by their surnames given that the case is called Dyatlov pass?

You know what? It probably would have been, but now I've written all of these notes with the first names, so we're kind of fucked. 

I mean it probably wouldn't have been. One of the Yuri's is Krivonischenko, there's a Thibeaux-Brignolles - beautiful Russian name... 

Beautiful.

... Doroshenko, Dubinina, Kolevatov, Kolmogorova, Slobodin...

Yeah okay, I'm happy with my choice. 

... and Zolotaryov.

So Semyon is the 38 year old, and he, I think, was not a student at the university. He's a professional tour guide from what I understand it, and a veteran who fought in World War II. I think he met some of them, or Dyatlov, or someone, and decided to tag along with their group. And this wasn't like unheard of, or weird, at the time. So the goal of the trip was to reach Otorten, and the group left the city of Sverdlovsk, now Yekaterinburg, on the 23rd of January 1959, to begin their hike. Okay, let's just make a blanket excuse and say - sorry for the mispronunciations. 

And by mispronunciations we mean mispronunciations. Oh, the irony. \[Laughter]

So they reached Vizhai, the last inhabited settlement before the mountains, on the 27th of January, and they set off into the wilderness the next morning. That day, Yuri Yudin realized that he would not be able to continue on the trip as his rheumatism flared up, and he returned to Vizhai. Little did they know that he would be the only surviving member of the group. Dyatlov told the sports club that they belonged to, that were financing the trip, that he would telegram them when the group reached Vizhai on the 12th of February. But he told Yudin that he was expecting a delay of a couple of days. Remember when we had telegrams? \[Laughter]

Telegram for Sandra! You need to leave. \[Laughter]

That is not the first time I've heard that. Kidding. Or am I? And I think why he was expecting a delay was because of the bad weather, but I'm not sure.

I think with this kind of trip, or any kind of difficult trip, there's always a plus or minus amount of days. Simply because you can't predict what's going to happen, or how long it's going to take. It's usually like: "we'll arrive on this day, but we might be a couple of days late".

Yeah. Yeah, that's true. The group made a mock newspaper documenting their trip, and took photos throughout their journey all the way up to the day before the incident, which made it possible for investigators to know exactly what route they had taken. This mock newspaper thing is so cute, and also so sad. What we know is that the group reached a highland area on the 31st of January, where they would begin the climb. They stored provisions that would be used for the journey back in a wooded valley, and the next day they began to move through the pass, and planned to set up camp for the night on the other side of the pass. But the weather worsened, and the group accidentally started going west towards the top of Dead Mountain, or Kholat Syakhl... we're gonna say close enough, no? 

Yes. Sorry, I had to think about that whether I was gonna let you off with it or not.

Being a Russian expert. 

Da.

Our Russian correspondent. They realized their mistake, but decided to set up camp on the slope of the mountain rather than backtrack downhill 1.5 kilometers, or 0.9 miles, to a wooded area which would have provided more shelter against the weather. Yudin speculated that this could have been either because the group didn't want to lose the progress they had gained by going uphill, because we all know what a pain it is to go uphill, especially in snow. Have you been skiing? Was that a thing that you ever did? 

I can't ski with my knees! 

No, but like in your childhood?

I'm not made of money. 

We used to take school trips skiing.

We don't have mountains. 

Oh yeah! No, that makes sense actually. But going uphill in snow is a pain. 

Going uphill in the dry is a pain. 

True story bro. So he also speculated that it might have been because they wanted to practice camping on the mountain slope. On the 20th of February there had been no word from the group, and their families wanted a rescue group to be sent out. At first the university they went to sent out a group consisting of volunteer students and teachers to find them, but later on the police got involved and sent out helicopters and planes to aid the search. On the 26th, they discovered the abandoned campsite. And I'm guessing this took a while because it wasn't the route that they were planning on taking, because they got a bit lost because of the bad weather.

And also snow. 

Yeah, and also snow. What they found was a badly damaged tent that had been cut from the inside, all of the groups belongings and some of their shoes were still in the tent. And nine pairs, or six, or eight depending on what source you're reading, of footprints were still visible in the snow leading away from the tent. From the footprints they could tell that some of the hikers had been barefoot, some of them were clad in socks or wearing a single shoe. And also, a thing that should be said is that they could tell that they hadn't been running from the tent. They could tell that the footprints were from walking, which was a thing that I found very, very weird when I first read about this case a couple of years ago.

Why? 

I don't know. I just feel like - why would you leave a tent in a panic by cutting it up from the inside, and then that panic not being there when you actually get out of the tent?

Because they weren't panicking.

Yeah, probably. I just couldn't understand. If you weren't panicked, why wouldn't you take your shoes, and your jacket, and stuff like that? So a thing that maybe should be said as well, is that...

Butt. 

No, I'm gonna get to it. So the footprints...

What?

I'm thinking about the flashlights, but that's probably for later. 

I said butts. 

Oh booties!

And you were like: "no, I'm gonna get to it later". Like, what? \[Laughter] What? 

Oh, didn't you know about the butts? \[Laughter]

No, I didn't read that. They didn't have any! \[Laughter]

So the footprints led down to a wooden area on the other side of the pass, which I'm thinking is the wooded area where they decided not to backtrack to, because it was in the same distance. But I'm not sure. And at the edge of the forest they discovered remnants of a small fire. Here, the bodies of Yuri Krivonichenko and Yuri Doroshenko were found, both were in their underwear. The branches of the tree where the fire had been were damaged, which could indicate that someone had climbed it trying to get a better view of something. Maybe they were looking for the campsite, I don't know. Nobody knows.

igor diatlov sinaida

were found between the fire and the

campsite

and poses suggesting that they had been

attempting to return

to the tent as i understand it they were

found

crawling uphill or not crawling because

they were dead by imposes suggesting

that they had been crawling uphill

maybe they were unaware of where

the wooded area was maybe they thought

that it was closer closer than

what then what it was why does it make a

difference

i'm just confused about why they would

walk that

far although downhill it takes

much less time than uphill it would have

provided

cover yeah they could have started the

fire so

it would have offered them their best

chance of survival yeah to me it seems

like a

logical step whether you know that it's

1500 meters away or a mile away

yeah no that does make sense i'm just

confused about why they didn't stay

longer at the fire maybe it did make

sense

at the time and that i'm just not an

experienced hiker because i'm not

surprise surprise sitting here with my

beer

so the remaining four members of the

group were not found until

two months later under 13 feet or four

meters of snow

three of these were wearing more clothes

than the other bodies

had been found in indicating that they

had taken the clothing

from their group members after they died

as

ludmila was wearing yuri's burned

torn trousers one of the oris that were

found by the fire and this does make

sense

so after the first bodies were

discovered the cause of death was

hypothermia but when the other bodies

were discovered people became suspicious

of

foul play maybe we should talk about

what kind of

conditions the bodies were found in well

well well

so the five that died of hypothermia

had no injuries that might have led

to their deaths slobodan rustam

yeah did have a small skull fracture

but that was deemed non-fatal and that

probably coincided

with the broken tree branches in the

it's hypothesized he climbed up the tree

and fell down

on his head i didn't know that so

four bodies were found at the bottom of

the creek

and three of them had severe soft tissue

damage

okay yeah so tibo brignoles

didn't dubinina was missing the tongue

eyes lips and part of her face

zolotariov was missing eyes

and kalevitov was missing eyebrows

oh only the eyebrows yeah they have a

weird thing to go missing

but the forensic pathologist vos rajdani

determined that all of these soft tissue

injuries

were post-mortem yeah that's what i read

as well

so they all occurred after they died and

it makes sense

because these are the typical parts of

the body that

scavengers in terms of animals would go

for

it's quite well documented that if

you're a little old lady

in a house full of cats and you die they

will eat your face

anyway tibo brignoli suffered

a major skull fracture

dubinina and solitariov both

had major chest fractures the

interesting thing

about these wounds is that the force

that was needed to do it would have been

equal to that of being in a car crash

and there were no external wounds

they had no soft tissue wounds that

would have coincided with this

internal damage so when you've got that

kind of

internal wound but nothing on the

outside it's indicative of that being

performed or received under high amounts

of pressure

the important thing about those two sets

of clinical symptoms

is that you can rule out any case of

someone else inflicting that bodily harm

i also heard about some burn marks on

the skin

is this something you read about i did

read

of it but it was a glancing reference

the only thing that i can imagine it

coming from is once they've got the fire

up

they were so friggin cold that they got

too close

yeah which would make sense because of

the trek

towards the wood i imagine it's probably

more the fact that they were in their

underwear

yeah but they might have had clothing

that the other people

took when they died yeah they still

weren't fully kitted out were they it

was like

trousers no no no shoes no yeah

yeah yeah i've got more so i did get a

bit of a summary

of where we would be up to in the case

but also where the investigators were up

to

which might be helpful so there were no

indications

of anybody else around so you mentioned

that earlier with the

random number of footprints or sets of

footprints away from the tent

might have been all nine of them might

have been less than that but there

wasn't more

from what i've read there's between five

and nine

so there's more than nine however you

look at it

so like you say they know that the tent

was cut open

from within they all died within six to

eight

hours of their last meal which is

significant if you're looking at things

like poisoning

yeah one of the sources that i read said

that they all

left of their own accord on foot

apparently there was no source of

dragging

there was radiation found

on one set of the clothing yeah i think

it was more than one set of the clothing

but that might be wrong when i'm done

okay so because people became suspicious

of foul play

because of the four bodies found in may

they interrogated and tortured a couple

of

mansi the local indigenous reindeer

herders on the suspicion that they had

attacked the group for trespassing on

their land

this seemed highly unlikely though as

you said

there was no additional footprints at

the tent site and none of the bodies

had injuries that indicated a fight not

to mention that the mansi people were

peaceful

and probably didn't give a that

there were people

camping in the mountains i would be

very surprised if they gave one

about that the mansi people had also

helped with the search

and the four bodies discovered in may

were discovered because

of a mancy tracker and hunter who had

found a part of lyudmila's

sweater in the snow so they were

volunteering

to open the search and fun facts about

the nancy people

in legends they are said to have been

riding moose

or the origin elk into battle

which is probably not true but i really

hope that it is

i can't confirm they did do that

as i heard in the stuff you should know

episode

that apparently they ingest

hallucinogenic

mushrooms by feeding the hallucinogenic

mushrooms that are poisonous

for their reindeer and then drinking

their best yes have you heard about this

i don't know if it was specifically this

group of indigenous people

but it's quite common in far northern

hemisphere

tribes to do that so just wanted to push

that out there before you could finish

your sentence so that you know that i

knew stuff

of course so one of the fancy people

living in the area

now or at the time when they did the bbc

article stated to the bbc that they

absolutely did not have anything to do

with the incident

because why would they and also there's

no evidence to suggest

that they did and he stated that he

believes that there's a technological

explanation for what transpired

we just don't know what it is other

theories about what happened include

the group was attacked and chased by

wildlife

and the things that contradict this

theory is that there were no

animal footprints found around the tent

and speaking of which

sinaida had been in a relationship with

one of the yuris

yuri doroshenko and had fallen in love

with him

on a previous expedition or hiking trip

when he chased off a brown bear

with a geologist's hammer so they

probably wouldn't have

panicked cut up the tent and left

all of the clothing and belongings at

the side of a bear

also worth mentioning that the

slope that they camped on in mancy

translates as like a lack of prey or a

lack of animals

so also unlikely to have been

a wild animal attack unlikely yeah

one other theory is catabotic

wind which is rare events of extremely

violent winds and this i think

is the theory of two swedish people

that went to the diathlov pass

and did some investigation of their own

i guess

and said that at least one such

incident has happened in a mountain in

sweden

where eight hikers died and the

topography of where that happened in

sweden

is very similar to the topography

of the campsite so maybe maybe not

yeah katabatic winds are also they're

described as

rare phenomena but also

are incredibly common in specific places

in the world

so i feel like if you meet the

conditions for katabatic wind

then they can happen regularly i just

think there's probably not that many

places that have it

yeah that's true speaking of winds did

you know that it can rain fish

have you been reading the bible again no

true story bro

i looked it up because i was like nah

this sounds like to

me turns out it can happen but

it happens when there's a hurricane or

typhoon what is a typhoo a typhoon is a

hurricane at sea

oh okay so it sucks them all up from the

sea

and then drops them when it gets

overland yeah

exactly funny story it has happened

plenty of times in recorded history i

was like this is

hilarious yeah happens during

egyptian times apart from it as frogs

not fish

yeah but it has also happened with frogs

but

i was making a biblical reference you

turdington

yeah but it also has happened with frogs

so i'm guessing so i'm guessing that

might be the hurricanes

i understood i just wanted to fact check

yeah so why did the nile turn into blood

it didn't it was clay

so another theory is infrasound

wind going around the kolatsyakal

created a karman vortex street

which can produce infrasound capable of

inducing

panic attacks in humans this theory

could

maybe explain why the group fled the

tent and then

when they were out of the infrasound's

path

they would have regained mental clarity

which explains trying to return to the

tent

and the other theory is the military

tests

there were records of parachute mines

being tested by the soviet military in

the area

around the time when the hikers were

there

they theorized that maybe the group woke

up by a loud

explosion and fled because of the shock

parachute mines detonate while still in

the air

and leads to injuries similar to those

experienced by

the hikers as i understand it so

that's heavy internal damage with

relatively

little external trauma the theory

coincides with reported sightings of

glowing orange orbs floating or falling

in the sky

because there were witness statements

taken

about these glowing orbs although

these eyewitness statements were first

taken

a couple of years after this happened so

i'm not sure

and then one source said that the hikers

allegedly photographed them so i looked

for the alleged photos of these light

phenomenons

and there is two photos there's some

flash

thing in one of the photos and then the

other photo

is very bright i'm guessing this

might be exposure problems

another theory is radiological

weapons that could explain the

radioactive residue found on some of the

people as well as some of the belongings

or the clothing as well as the bodies

having an orange

or brick red skin color as well as gray

hair

although this is probably explained

by mummification as i understand it

i couldn't find the autopsy photos so

i'm not sure

that actually is a thing that did happen

i might be able to help you out on this

in that it's quite common and

i don't know what the frequency of it

happening

is but there's one pathologist who this

is a sign

that he looks for to confirm hypothermia

it's a condition called frost erythema

also colloquially known as stoplight

knees

it's a general reddening of your skin

caused by a very complicated process

involving carboxyhemoglobin and

oxyhemoglobin

but basically your oxygen in your

bloodstream will bind to one or the

other and it will cause this

reddening of your skin which

seems to coincide a bit more with the

facts rather than

some crazy theory yeah i get it

and that's why i thought that the

mummification thing was

partly explainable because i felt like

the

bodies they found in the permafrost

are really darkened so kind of guess

that it has to do

with the cold environment no

i remember seeing the picture of the guy

the oldest ever tattooed person

i might have been a lady might have been

a lady yeah

oh woman

yeah they were pretty brown it was like

going out for a night out in essex

but i read on reddit a long time ago

oh here we go and i spent quite some

time

trying to fish out that reddit post but

i couldn't find it

but i read that one of them or more

was working at a laboratory at the time

which might have been the cause for the

radiation and it wasn't a lot of

radiation

it was like a tiny bit of radiation as i

understand it

no i don't know the exact amounts but

i'm inclined

to think that it was only a small amount

yeah i think i read somewhere like the

exact amount

but they said that this is a normal

exposure amount of radiation to

something that is

not that radioactive yeah so it ain't no

big bomb

yeah or the national geographic

article mentions in passing

that at the time camping lights

had some sort of radioactive element to

them

which would make sense in the context in

that it was low level radiation

and it was only on a few of

them or their things the people that

were closest to the source of the light

probably would have had a higher

exposure

maybe yeah so another theory is aliens

obviously okay case closed we're done

here

because of the infamous photographs

that i don't think is that telling at

all because you can't really see what's

going on it just

looks like bad exposure and also

other eyewitness statements about the

glowing orbs

in the sky it's called the moon

i also read that there's another theory

about

semyon snakes

sorry my parcel tongue is a bit rusty

there's another theory about

semyon and they said that he was a kgb

agent

sent there to kill them for some reason

because nobody in soviet russia can have

grade 3

hiking license

that would have been funny but because

he was a world war

ii veteran because he was an outsider in

the group

in some way because he had his camera

on him suspicious when they died

so none of them had shoes but he had a

camera

but i'm guessing that he was probably

wearing the camera

in the tent when this happened but not

his shoes i am suspicious

but i think that someone said that the

outlaw

forced everyone in the group to wash

their feet

every night which might be true might

not be true but it sounds weird do you

not

remember the dan radcliff radclaf

the film we watched jungle yeah

wash your feet bro yeah it might be some

hiking thing

it was the same conditions isn't it they

were hiking through the jungle so they

were getting wet feet

you're hiking through snow you get wet

feet make sure they're clean and dry

that's true i did believe the fire

theory for a while there and the fire

theory

is that they had a stove in the tent and

the theory was that the

stove fell over and things started

burning which would explain the burn

injuries

on the bodies and also some of the burnt

clothing

and also the panic to get out of the

tent

but i will say this on the burnt

clothing thing

sinaida wrote in one of our last diary

entries that

quote all day long we followed the river

at night we'll camp on a mansi trail

i burned my mittens and yora's

jacket at the campfire he cursed me

a lot yura is one of the yuris

so it might have been that they

sometimes came close

to the fire i think that would make

sense

in the you're spending all this time

hiking through the freezing cold

the only chance you ever get to dry out

is when you stop at night

for the fire so they probably got too

close with their clothing

and then when they were in the state of

hyperthermia and confusion

because they'd escaped their tent then

they probably got a bit complacent with

their person yeah

and that's where the body burns come in

like having hiked

in a rain forest i know all too easily

how difficult it is to get dry clothing

and how tempting you are to just move

everything

closer to the fire just to dry it out

quicker yeah

maybe we should discuss the theory

that is prevalent now when they say

that science has solved the diet love

pass

incident but we already talked about the

aliens

yeah the avalanche oh

the avalanche that was caused by the

alien landing

got here so

given that this is a nice mountainous

hilly landscape covered in snow with

very strong winds

why has it taken until 2020

to conclude that it was an avalanche

subscribe and like to find out why

i think they first said that it was an

avalanche

quite soon but now they've

successfully explained the evidence

obviously one of the first theories

was avalanche there are a number of

reasons why they thought that it could

have been

an avalanche and then also

a number of reasons why this was

pooh-poohed

let's go through why they ruled out

avalanche

or why it's been a mystery for the last

50 years now one of the biggest

reasons that they thought it couldn't

have been an avalanche was that there

was

no debris left behind

that would have been indicative of an

avalanche now they caused

massive amounts of damage the tent would

have been

completely submerged the cops of trees

where they made their fire would have

been destroyed

you would have seen more signs of an

avalanche

had it been an avalanche also another

reason

was that a lot of the weather reports

and hiking reports and things like that

from other people in the area had never

shown

any sign of avalanche before it wasn't

recorded

as being an avalanche risk zone another

one of the reasons

was that these were all experienced

hikers

part of your grade two is to

traverse a peak on rock snow

and ice and they were all grade two

going up to grade three so they'd all

hiked on ice and snow before they

wouldn't have camped

in a known avalanche path just wouldn't

have done it

you would have taken that sacrifice of

going those 1500 meters back downhill

to get out of the way of an avalanche

rather than

risk it one of the reasons that you can

rule out or rule in a zone for being an

avalanche risk

is the topography and at the time

they thought that the slopes were too

shallow

and then one of the biggest things is

that usually

victims who fall to an avalanche

asphyxiate because they've been

submerged in the snow

there is usually not the blunt force

trauma

that you would see with the victims

that were found and there's usually no

chance of escape

from an avalanche if you know you're in

an avalanche

it's too late yeah unless you get found

so

with modern science the case was

reinvestigated

it's been reinvestigated multiple times

over the years

but with this latest one that i think

started in 2019

might have been earlier i think the

investigation started

2015 but it went up to

2019. okay yeah makes sense

so they looked at the weather conditions

historically

and currently and found that

the weather at the pass could be

particularly brutal

they could get winds up to 70

to 100 kilometers an hour that's about

45 to 70 miles an hour

temperatures can plummet down to minus

40 degrees

and these weren't conditions that were

considered by the

original investigators one of the

biggest factors was that the

hikers dug their tent into the side

of the slope so they didn't camp on the

surface they dug it in so they would

have a flat camp

now what that does is weaken what's

called the snow base

which is the underlying layer of snow

that causes all of the stability is that

hard

clumpy stuff rather than the soft

surface snow

they also found with modern

topographical techniques

that the slopes weren't that shallow at

all

they looked into all of the topography

of the area and the particular region

where they set up

camp had a 30 degree

angle of slope which is

really steep also fun fact for you

the minimum requirement for an avalanche

is 30 degrees oh

what a coincidence so during

this reinvestigation the team that were

looking at it

were spending a little bit of down time

and watching frozen

as you do and they were super impressed

with

the animation of the snow in frozen

they're like hey this looks like snow

that's

pretty incredible so they spoke to

disney

and managed to get hold of their coders

for the animation yeah so they went to

hollywood

took this animation code and

reprogrammed it

to simulate the conditions on the

mountain

they also had a bunch of crash test data

from general motors

general motors had a bunch of data about

blunt force trauma and impact injuries

for safety testing for their cars so

what the investigators did is they

paired this

data together so they had the new

topography data

from the new investigations they had the

new

animation code from the frozen team

and they had the blunt force trauma

information from general motors

the combination of the frozen data

and the topography showed that

it was very much possible for

an avalanche to have occurred at the

specific

time that these guys were camping this

is a

slow avalanche no yeah

it has a certain name and i think slow

avalanche is probably right

because it's not that whole massive

cascade of snow

it was a very very localized event

because they had dug their tent

in and weakened the snow base so what

they concluded with

the animation is that there would have

been

an avalanche block rather than

a massive wall that they estimated would

have been about 16

foot long which is about the size of a

standard

people carrier like a nine person taxi

or something

in terms of avalanche speak that's

really really small

but they've proven it could have been

possible

and it fits with all the rest of the

data

in that the tent wouldn't have been

completely submerged

it wouldn't have flowed all the way down

the mountainside into the cops of trees

at the bottom of the hill where they

were camping so you would have seen no

damage from that

because it was such a small avalanche it

would have been covered

by snows that would have come afterwards

so you wouldn't have seen any of the

movement

or anything like that now i'm a bit

confused

about where and when the blunt force

trauma injuries

occurred me too i wasn't gonna ask you a

question about that

okay so this study that was published

in the national geographic has said that

in the tent some of the bedding

that was found had been placed on top of

their skis

to form a base layer for their mattress

type

thing now when you coincide

the general motors data about

force and crash velocity they concluded

that the strength of the avalanche

and the pressures involved would explain

the blunt force traumas that the victims

had

without having any of the surface trauma

so they thought that the fact that a

couple of these

hikers had slept on their skis

is what caused them to have their rib

fractures and their skull fractures

etc which would make sense because if

not all of them were doing it then not

all of them would have had the same

level of damage

now if you've got a fatal skull

fracture yeah you're not just gonna hop

out of bed

jump out of the tent walk down to the

trees with everybody else and then

die that is the question some of the

other stories

have said that they fell down a ravine

and that's why they ended up in the

river or the stream or whatever

which also makes sense because if

there's been light snowfall

it could quite easily hide loose footing

where they could have fallen but if they

had

fallen that wouldn't have accounted for

their injuries

because then they would have had surface

injuries

you can't fracture your skull without

laceration

bruising to your head so the fall

wouldn't have caused the injuries

could you survive for a while with that

amount of internal damage

i think the ones with chest fractures

probably could they've been in a and

solitary off

yeah i don't think our boy tebow would

have been in any condition

to walk down the hill with a major skull

fracture

they could have carried him i suppose

yeah which would then

accommodate for the fewer number of

footprints

it's one of those things that i don't

think we'll ever know

no i would be inclined to think that

they probably carried him from

camp but he was obviously still alive

otherwise they would have just left it

behind

yeah it seems incredulous

because of the fact that the people with

internal damage survived

longer than the people without internal

injuries

yeah because they were all the ones with

the extra clothing they had the extra

clothing because they lasted long enough

to take it off of their campmates who

have died

which then doesn't lend towards them

already having

their injuries yeah exactly unless

the guys that died of hypothermia gave

them their clothing

to try and increase their chances to

survive

then realized wait that's a

stupid idea

let's go back to camp and get more

clothes and died on the way up

i think i sold

they it the clothing on the people that

were injured

that were because i read somewhere that

someone

went there maybe it was the bbc article

maybe it was

the swedish people that went there to

investigate i don't know

but they said that the place where the

four other bodies were discovered

weren't that far away from the fire

so it was in speaking distance like they

could have

spoken to each other so they put the

injured people

there and then they all died and then

the snow

fell upon the injured people and then

the end yeah isn't that an epiphany

I was like: "I've solved it!". I didn't solve it but, you know. 

It sounds like you solved it to me.

Okay! We've done the shit.

We've done the shiiit. 

So on the 11th of July 2020, Andrey Kuryakov, deputy head of the Urals federal district dictate of the prosecutor-general's office, announced an avalanche to be the official cause of death for the Dyatlov group in 1959. That was a quote from wikipedia. I didn't want to write: "the deputy head of the Urals federal district dictate of the prosecutor-general's office", by myself. I was like: "we're gonna quote that". And the area where the incident took place is now named Dyatlov pass in honor of the hiking group leader, Igor. Yeah. That's the case! Thank you so much for listening to Midweek Murders, we'll see you next week. Bye-bye! 

Goodbye to you.
