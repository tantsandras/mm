  Midweek Murders contains graphic and
  explicit content,
  listener discretion is advised.
  Oh! Oh ho hoo!
  Crystal is clanking!
  I've opted for uh glenmoray single malt
  18 pounds from tesco, other
  retailers are available. Well somebody is
  living life. Yeah
  well, I had to go to the shops because
  it's father's day in the uk tomorrow and
  I hadn't got my dad anything
  hmm what are you gonna get him I got him
  some dessert flavored chocolates
  and a fancy bottle of
  birra morate which I think is an italian
  brand of beer.
  I'm not sure. These continental europeans,
  it's post-brexit I don't care about them.
  [Music]
  that would have been a good opening of
  the episode
  people are gonna kill us for that, no
  they aren't,
  because nobody listens
  um we had 47 bots
  download our podcast thank you very much.
  True story. Of which I would like to
  express
  my eternal gratitude thank you
  the programmers who have created a bot
  to download
  any old kind of shit from the internet
  [Music]
  It was very funny she broke into the
  bedroom
  very decisively... oh I heard that!
  You can't come here and just scream at
  me
  what is the point?! Oh god, no, she can't
  get out.
  What is.. oh my god,
  she answered you but not me.
  Bodil, do you want to get out?
  I walked into the radiator on my way
  back.
  Smooth. Smooth as
  caramel. Or smooth as that
  whiskey you bought from tesco for 18
  pounds. It's actually pretty nice.
  Will you tell Bodil to shut up? She's
  introducing a lot of background noise.
  I think she wants dinner. She is very
  much
  wanting to be in this room but when
  she's in, she's like I can't get out, i
  can't get out.
  What did you do to me? I was like you did
  this to yourself.
  I know that feeling it's every time we
  press record.
  [Laughter]
  Am I holding you hostage in our friendship?
  [Laughter]
  Okay should we start? I've been waiting
  for you to start
  for 15 minutes.
  Oh god. Play the jingle.
  It worked last time.
  You're listening to Midweek Murders,
  and it's time to talk about crime.
  That's what I'm talking about! Do the
  introductions!
  Oh my god, nooo. I'm sandra
  and this is my friend Joe. Say hi Joe.
  Hi Joe. Oh I knew you were gonna go for
  that one, low
  hanging fruit.
  On today's episode [get's interrupted again], on today's episode.
  [Laughter]
  Sorry, sorry you're doing great.
  We're good.
  Okay I'm ready. Today we're gonna talk
  about the pimlico mystery.
  So our case starts on
  the 1st of january 1886
  when adelaide... ADELAIDE!
  Adelaide,
  you know like the place.
  [Laughter]
  I actually practiced her name
  like by myself on the toilet when I was
  pooping. A lot of times
  before we started recording, and I still can't
  say them. 
  You should probably cut the pooping part
  out.
  Adelaide. Adelaide, yeah okay.
  I'm gonna... Like the place in america.
  Is that a place in america? Yeah it is.
  The case we're gonna talk about today is
  the pimlico mystery
  and it started the first of january
  1886 when
  adelaide called her landlord to say:
  "come down I think miss Mr Bartlett is
  dead"
  and Mr Bartlett was Thomas Edwin
  Bartlett.
  Her husband.
  That's the one. She married Thomas Edwin
  Bartlett when she was 19 and he was
  29. Still younger than I am right now.
  Oh yeah.
  And Thomas Edwin Bartlett had been
  diagnosed with
  subacute gastritis a couple of weeks
  before
  he was poisoned, I think. What is
  sub-acute gastritis?
  You know so gastritis
  is the inflammation
  of the gastric system so it's like
  your abdominals, and
  your stomach, and places like that.
  And inflammation is that like IBS or is
  it...
  It could be yeah, so it's a
  general medical term
  to encompass an entire range
  of inflammatory diseases. So it could be
  IBS,
  it could be inflammatory bowel disease.
  I'm pretty sure that's what IBS is. Yeah,
  I was just gonna say irritable bowel
  syndrome,
  I think it stands for. So they married
  kind of ten years before in 1875.
  Their friend, or spiritual guide,
  or spiritual counsel and
  a five-time winner of witch weekly's
  most charming
  smile award
  [Laughter]
  reverend George Dyson had
  bought the chloroform at four different
  stores,
  in such a small capacity that he didn't
  have to
  sign his name. And the
  product that he bought, because if he had
  bought
  the same amount of chloroform at one
  store...
  Wait, shit, I should have said where I got
  my...
  Well I can say it now. I got my research
  from
  murderpedia.org.
  Whereas I got my information from
  uh wikipedia and
  a pubmed article published by
  duchenne jayawira at al, that was
  probably about
  seven different authors. And uh
  the BMJ which was authored by an
  m farrell. Oh.
  You did so much more research than I did.
  Yeah like three times as many sources.
  I think it's important to
  mention that Thomas Edwin Bartlett had a history
  of
  conditions that he was being treated for.
  So he had several teeth removed,
  he had his teeth filed down into stumps,
  and it was well documented by Adelaide
  that their relationship was
  non-sexual because of his
  foul aroma. Oh.
  Did she actually say that? I'm not sure
  if those are her exact
  words, but it I think it was mentioned in
  her trial that they
  didn't regularly consummate
  their marriage
  because she was off put by the smell
  from his mouth.
  Well one thing's for sure, he was not
  a five-time witch weekly most charming
  smile award winner. He's no gilderoy
  lockhart let's put it that way.
  To be honest, I never fancied gilderoy 
  Lockhart, did you?
  No, but I am susceptible to a nice set of
  teeth.
  Well Adelaide probably was as well.
  Yeah, and that's why they never boned.
  But they did though, I read that
  she did have a baby fathered by
  Thomas that was still born I think. Wait.
  Yes it was delivered
  unfortunately deceased.
  And Thomas Bartlett was very reluctant
  to have any kind of medical help
  in that delivery, whether that's any
  significance to his character or the
  case at all
  remains to be determined.
  I did read that he had said
  during the delivery that he didn't want
  a doctor's help because he didn't want
  another man
  interfering with her, which is curious
  because she said that she was encouraged
  to have a relationship
  with George Dyson, the
  minister. Yeah so the sources that I
  read also confirmed that they were
  encouraged to have a relationship in so
  much as that he didn't
  mind them kissing in front of him.
  But that's what they said, wasn't it? Yeah
  that was the opinion of Adelaide
  and George. Yeah so,
  Adelaide Blanche de la Tremoille
  married him, as I said when she was 19,
  and he came from a very close-knit
  family
  of prosperous grocers and
  some sources say that she, well I say some
  sources, I only read the murder pedia so
  what do I know.
  But it's like difference in opinion I
  think,
  about like how much they
  accepted her into the family. Which
  doesn't obviously make
  any difference to what happened in the
  end,
  but her father-in-law accused her of
  having a sexual relationship
  with Thomas's younger brother.
  Yes, yeah that's seconded
  in the sources that I read. Yeah so the
  the father-in-law was a
  a particularly strong voice
  against their relationship,
  which of course is hard to say anything
  about
  because it was so long ago, but
  might have been might have not have been.
  Thomas Bartlett
  had drafted a will before he fell
  acutely ill,
  as it seemed leaving everything to
  Adelaide and there was a stipulation in
  that will, saying that
  she couldn't remarry if she had
  inherited his estate.
  But then they redrew the will,
  or he redrew the will, and made George
  Dyson an executor of that will,
  and removed the bar
  where it said that adelaide couldn't
  remarry.
  And that, for me, also indicates murder.
  It's quite suspicious that George Dyson
  should come on the scene, and
  somehow Thomas Bartlett would redraft
  his
  entire will, in that not only would
  Adelaide
  inherit, but she was now also allowed to
  remarry and basically do whatever she
  wanted.
  And that also happened just four months
  before he died,
  so for me that's like a red flag. I
  concur.
  The doctor that was treating Thomas
  Bartlett was dr alfred leach,
  and leach said that he prescribed
  chloroform
  reluctantly, but that Thomas
  insisted on that. Which is also
  a bit strange, but I guess like if he
  couldn't
  get to sleep, at some point you get
  desperate.
  So I think it's important to note here,
  that at the time chloroform
  was like a seen as a miracle drug.
  It had recently come onto the scene, a
  lot of
  different countries and practitioners
  have used chloroform as the perfect
  anesthetic,
  the perfect drug that would send you to
  sleep,
  so it was it was widely used throughout
  continental europe for both pain relief
  and as an analgesic. So
  to ask your practitioner to prescribe
  you chloroform in those times
  was less questionable than it would be
  in today's economy. Just like
  if I were have to been alive at that
  time they would have prescribed me
  cocaine and vaginal stimulus.
  Well we went, we went different ways with
  that.
  The mystery around the pimlico mystery
  is that Adelaide
  and Dyson was put on trial, but
  mostly Adelaide,
  for poisoning him, Thomas Bartlett,
  because at the autopsy they discovered
  a lethal dose of chloroform in his
  stomach.
  But the mystery of it is that he didn't
  have
  abrasions in his throat or
  mouth. Like if he had
  swallowed chloroform there would have
  been like,
  wear I guess? Yeah so chloroform
  is a nasty liquid to administer
  through the digestive tract, and
  quite often medics will see
  that liquid chloroform
  will cause a lot of problems.
  So one article that was in the BMJ
  was of someone that tried to overdose
  with 99% chloroform
  in liquid form, so they admitted that one
  particular lady into AE and she had
  a hepatotoxicity, which is
  liver failure she had severe gastritis
  and ulceration,
  she had severe enterocolitis which is
  inflammatory
  of the digestive tract and the colon,
  she had erosive esophagitis,
  and she also had dermal secretions
  of the chloroform. So the question
  of the pimlico murders is how
  Adelaide managed to administer
  a lethal dose of liquid chloroform, which
  was confirmed in the autopsy,
  but yet how Thomas Bartlett
  had no signs of the corrosion
  or the burning. And the erosion
  of his esophagus or his intestinal tract
  from that chloroform. But what I
  wonder is like, how much do you
  digest chloroform?
  Chloroform in itself is a well-absorbed
  metabolite,
  it's quickly metabolized and eliminated
  within
  the body. Okay so it could have been, it
  couldn't have been like a
  poisoning throughout a couple of months
  because then
  that's... No definitely not.
  So a couple of studies that are quoted
  in wikipedia have got
  a half-life of chloroform at 6.5
  hours, so that means that if you had
  a 10 milliliter dose
  within six and a half hours that would
  have been metabolized down to a five
  milliliter dose. So it's
  really quickly absorbed, and also
  it's interesting to note that in the
  autopsy
  they only found six to eight
  drops of pure chloroform
  in the stomach. But they did also find
  ulceration in the colon,
  which would suggest that it was
  administered
  orally and absorbed in the time frame
  between when it was administered and
  when it was reported by Adelaide.
  Which was supposedly a three-hour
  difference.
  Oh only a three-hour difference? Yeah
  he went to bed and then in the morning
  she called
  the landlord. Sources vary,
  but from what I've read, it was a around
  three to four
  hours later that she reported
  to her landlord that her husband was
  dead. Okay,
  all right, when I first read about this
  case
  I thought that well if you needed to
  administer
  a poison, well needed is... obviously
  she didn't need to, but you know, and
  there were no like signs of it in the
  mouth
  or the throat, I thought maybe she
  injected it in something that he would
  swallow whole
  without chewing but then I also realized
  there's not many food things that you
  would swallow a hole
  without chewing. And that raises the
  interesting point
  as to how significant
  thomas's dental treatment was and he was
  regularly seeing
  dentists and doctors regarding that
  and at the time chloroform was given
  as an analgesic as a as a pain relief
  so it's it's quite possible that
  in a combination of his
  remedial chloroform use as
  analgesic that the coroners
  whilst performing an autopsy wouldn't be
  able to pick up
  the same kind of corrosion from
  chloroform
  overdose that they would have done from
  a patient
  that hadn't administered chloroform
  orally
  okay so there might have been damage to
  his mouth
  they found chloroform in its pure liquid
  form in his stomach
  so you would have expected uh
  gastrointestinal
  damage but if he was already
  administering chloroform orally to
  inhale
  to help him sleep and we know that he
  was given it to rub into his gums
  it's possible that the damage that would
  have been caused by either inhalation or
  him rubbing it into his gums
  could have uh masked the damage that
  would have been
  seen through a toxic dose
  of chloroform being administered to him
  so you you're saying is that with the
  technical know-how that they had at the
  time they wouldn't have
  been able to prove that because of his
  already
  damaged mouth well there's there's a
  couple of theories
  as to how he died and I think
  the one that lends the most reliability
  sort of coincides with with what
  adelaide
  told the prosecution so um
  she told them that she had been using
  chloroform to help thomas get to sleep
  so she'd been in dabbing it onto a
  napkin
  and letting him inhale it
  and she followed that up once
  she'd realized that she had administered
  a lethal dose she offered him brandy
  which obviously has the burning and
  fiery taste that is associated
  with chloroform so if you if you ingest
  chloroform
  it's obviously going to burn your
  esophagus it's quite a
  similar sensation to drinking
  neat spirit bits so adelaide could
  quite easily have disguised drinking
  brandy
  as a correlation between administering
  chloroform
  to him so what you're saying is that
  it's not a mystery
  she just put the chloroform in there's
  no way to prove it
  but in combination between the pubmed
  and
  the bmj article that I read the sequence
  of events
  was that she used a chloroform
  rag to help him get to sleep to aid
  with his dental problems she then
  offered him
  brandy which as aforementioned has the
  burning and fiery taste
  she then could have it's not proven that
  she could have
  added the chloroform to a glass of wine
  which was found on the mantelpiece
  within
  reach of thomas edwin bartlett
  so if she added that chloroform to the
  wine
  as he drank it it could have also
  passed through his esophagus with the
  burning sensation that he would have
  associated with brandy
  and the pre-administered aspiration
  of the chloroform would have made him
  drowsy and a bit
  sleepy so he wouldn't have been 100
  aware of what's happening so you drink
  one drink
  it burns on the way down you think okay
  that's fine
  you drink another drink it burns on the
  way down
  you think okay that's fine it's the same
  drink
  you combine that with the bad condition
  of his mouth
  and also it's well documented
  that she said when she found him
  unconscious
  she poured brandy down his mouth to try
  and rouse him
  which could also be seen as an attempt
  to mask the smell of chloroform
  which is particularly sweet and so
  in my opinion it's quite likely that she
  spiked one of his drinks with the lethal
  dose of chloroform
  and the combination of that with his
  previous
  dental treatment explains
  why he didn't have the conditions
  coroners would have suspected
  because they were looking for damage and
  erosion to the gi tract but if he was
  already
  self-administering chloroform as
  an analgesic you would expect some
  level of that gi damage to have
  been in place already so more or less
  it is definitely possible that she
  poisoned him
  with a drink and then poured more drink
  or he swallowed more liquids and
  the traces in the esophagus and the
  mouth that should have been there wasn't
  there because he had swallowed
  other liquids yeah absolutely yeah i
  think
  the dilution effect of the white
  would have eased the conditions
  of the corrosion and the damage
  to the gi tract so more or less
  the pimlico mystery isn't actually a
  mystery anymore
  well it's hypothetical I wouldn't like
  to criticize
  the coroners at the time um
  the coroners were were crown prosecution
  coroners
  hold for applause
  [Laughter]
  excuse us listeners we're pissed
  it's the only way we can get over our
  social anxiety
  [Music]
  I'm so sweaty
  [Laughter]
  but I think at the time there wasn't the
  science available
  to determine the administration route
  and that's what got adelaide off
  because also the landlords found
  a bottle and they found that it smelled
  of brandy and some kind of
  ether ether has a typically sweet smell
  so they wouldn't have immediately
  identified it as chloroform
  but the fact that chloroform was readily
  available as prescription
  and that george dyson had
  suspicious circumstances in purchasing
  the chloroform leads towards the guilty
  prosecution of agile age
  but obviously without being able to
  autopsy
  and determine stomach contents
  and body condition and things like that
  it will forever remain a mystery
  but also like looking back on it now
  reverend dyson said that oh I didn't
  realize
  how suspicious this was
  until after I did it like
  buying the bottles of small amounts of
  chloroform from
  four different uh shops and stuff like
  that and I'm like oh
  it smells like ether to me no I mean
  like
  it smells like pre-meditative murder to
  me
  the laws at the time said that
  you only had to sign for and put a
  record down
  for volumes of chloroform that were
  high volume but if you had been
  told by someone to buy
  x amount of chloroform and you then
  went about it and went to all of these
  different chemists
  and suppliers and bought a volume
  below the level that you needed to
  supply
  a reasoning and a signature it
  does become slightly suspicious and then
  you tie that into the fact
  that thomas had changed his will
  yeah not long after meeting
  the vicar he was basically courting them
  he was allowing them to meet he didn't
  mind their relationship
  they could kiss in his presence while he
  was smoking a pipe in
  the corner of the room but I don't think
  he
  did actually allow them to do that i
  think that was
  like a rewrite of history from adelaide
  and george dyson because it's like well
  they said that that was the case which
  then begs even more questions
  as to why he changed his will I think
  that they probably persuaded him
  to take that like clause out
  of the will maybe when he was already
  drugged
  yeah and after that after the whole
  shebang she was acquitted by the way
  because they didn't have enough
  evidence she was also acquitted under
  um a statement to say that there's
  there's
  quite overwhelming evidence
  to suggest that she had done it they
  just
  couldn't prove how it had been
  administered without
  causing the damage that they would
  expect
  through oral administration
  did you feel like you solved it no
  I think it will always remain unsolved
  until someone looks at uh
  how easy it is to administer liquid
  chloroform
  through some kind of diluent it has to
  be
  possible right everything's
  possible so follow your dreams
  oh I did have a question um are you
  gonna do a trailer
  for every podcast or was it just a
  trailer
  for us in general it's a trailer for us
  in general
  okay but I might change it if I have
  something
  better if I have
  any shit to work with
  this is fine I was just curious
  and curious uh all right let's get on
  with this shit
  okay should we say bye to the bolts
  sure why not goodbye bots is
  it because we talked about the russian
  government last time that we have so
  many bought downloads
  so many it's it's quite possible
  bye russian bots hello russia

Oh! Oh ho hoo!
Crystal is clanking!
I've opted for uh glenmoray single malt
18 pounds from tesco, other

living life. Yeah
well, I had to go to the shops because
it's father's day in the uk tomorrow and
I hadn't got my dad anything
hmm what are you gonna get him I got him
some dessert flavored chocolates
and a fancy bottle of
birra morate which I think is an italian

I'm not sure. These continental europeans,
it's post-brexit I don't care about them.
That would have been a good opening of

People are gonna kill us for that, no
they aren't,
because nobody listens.
Um, we had 47 bots
download our podcast thank you very much.
True story. Of which I would like to

\[Music] 



It was very funny she broke into the
bedroom
very decisively... oh I heard that!
You can't come here and just scream at
me
what is the point?! Oh god, no, she can't
get out.
What is.. oh my god,
she answered you but not me.
Bodil, do you want to get out?
I walked into the radiator on my way
back.
Smooth. Smooth as
caramel. Or smooth as that
whiskey you bought from tesco for 18
pounds. It's actually pretty nice.
Will you tell Bodil to shut up? She's
introducing a lot of background noise.
I think she wants dinner. She is very
much
wanting to be in this room but when
she's in, she's like I can't get out, i
can't get out.
What did you do to me? I was like you did
this to yourself.
I know that feeling it's every time we
press record.
\[Laughter] Am I holding you hostage in our friendship?
\[Laughter] 



Okay should we start? I've been waiting
for you to start
for 15 minutes.
Oh god. Play the jingle.
It worked last time.
You're listening to Midweek Murders,
and it's time to talk about crime.
That's what I'm talking about! Do the
introductions!
Oh my god, nooo. I'm sandra
and this is my friend Joe. Say hi Joe.
Hi Joe. Oh I knew you were gonna go for
that one, low
hanging fruit.
On today's episode \[get's interrupted again], on today's episode. \[Laughter] Sorry, sorry you're doing great.
We're good.
Okay I'm ready. Today we're gonna talk
about the pimlico mystery.
So our case starts on
the 1st of january 1886
when adelaide... ADELAIDE!
Adelaide,
you know like the place.
\[Laughter] I actually practiced her name
like by myself on the toilet when I was
pooping. A lot of times
before we started recording, and I still can't
say them. 
You should probably cut the pooping part
out.
Adelaide. Adelaide, yeah okay.
I'm gonna... Like the place in america.
Is that a place in america? Yeah it is.
The case we're gonna talk about today is
the pimlico mystery
and it started the first of january
1886 when
adelaide called her landlord to say:
"come down I think miss Mr Bartlett is
dead"
and Mr Bartlett was Thomas Edwin
Bartlett.
Her husband.
That's the one. She married Thomas Edwin
Bartlett when she was 19 and he was 29. Still younger than I am right now. Oh yeah.
And Thomas Edwin Bartlett had been
diagnosed with
subacute gastritis a couple of weeks
before
he was poisoned, I think. What is
sub-acute gastritis?
You know so gastritis
is the inflammation
of the gastric system so it's like
your abdominals, and
your stomach, and places like that.
And inflammation is that like IBS or is
it...
It could be yeah, so it's a
general medical term
to encompass an entire range
of inflammatory diseases. So it could be
IBS,
it could be inflammatory bowel disease.
I'm pretty sure that's what IBS is. Yeah,
I was just gonna say irritable bowel
syndrome,
I think it stands for. So they married
kind of ten years before in 1875.
Their friend, or spiritual guide,
or spiritual counsel and
a five-time winner of witch weekly's
most charming
smile award
\[Laughter] reverend George Dyson had
bought the chloroform at four different
stores,
in such a small capacity that he didn't
have to
sign his name. And the
product that he bought, because if he had
bought
the same amount of chloroform at one
store...
Wait, shit, I should have said where I got
my...
Well I can say it now. I got my research
from
murderpedia.org.
Whereas I got my information from
uh wikipedia and
a pubmed article published by
duchenne jayawira at al, that was
probably about
seven different authors. And uh
the BMJ which was authored by an
m farrell. Oh.
You did so much more research than I did.
Yeah like three times as many sources.


I think it's important to
mention that Thomas Edwin Bartlett had a history
of
conditions that he was being treated for.
So he had several teeth removed,
he had his teeth filed down into stumps,
and it was well documented by Adelaide
that their relationship was
non-sexual because of his
foul aroma. Oh.
Did she actually say that? I'm not sure
if those are her exact
words, but it I think it was mentioned in
her trial that they
didn't regularly consummate
their marriage
because she was off put by the smell
from his mouth.
Well one thing's for sure, he was not
a five-time witch weekly most charming
smile award winner. He's no gilderoy
lockhart let's put it that way.
To be honest, I never fancied gilderoy 
Lockhart, did you?
No, but I am susceptible to a nice set of
teeth.
Well Adelaide probably was as well.
Yeah, and that's why they never boned.
But they did though, I read that
she did have a baby fathered by
Thomas that was still born I think. Wait.
Yes it was delivered
unfortunately deceased.
And Thomas Bartlett was very reluctant
to have any kind of medical help
in that delivery, whether that's any
significance to his character or the
case at all
remains to be determined.
I did read that he had said
during the delivery that he didn't want
a doctor's help because he didn't want
another man
interfering with her, which is curious
because she said that she was encouraged
to have a relationship
with George Dyson, the
minister. Yeah so the sources that I
read also confirmed that they were
encouraged to have a relationship in so
much as that he didn't
mind them kissing in front of him.
But that's what they said, wasn't it? Yeah
that was the opinion of Adelaide
and George. Yeah so,
Adelaide Blanche de la Tremoille
married him, as I said when she was 19,
and he came from a very close-knit
family
of prosperous grocers and
some sources say that she, well I say some
sources, I only read the murder pedia so
what do I know.
But it's like difference in opinion I
think,
about like how much they
accepted her into the family. Which
doesn't obviously make
any difference to what happened in the
end,
but her father-in-law accused her of
having a sexual relationship
with Thomas's younger brother.
Yes, yeah that's seconded
in the sources that I read. Yeah so the
the father-in-law was a
a particularly strong voice
against their relationship,
which of course is hard to say anything
about
because it was so long ago, but
might have been might have not have been.
Thomas Bartlett
had drafted a will before he fell
acutely ill,
as it seemed leaving everything to
Adelaide and there was a stipulation in
that will, saying that
she couldn't remarry if she had
inherited his estate.
But then they redrew the will,
or he redrew the will, and made George
Dyson an executor of that will,
and removed the bar
where it said that adelaide couldn't
remarry.
And that, for me, also indicates murder.
It's quite suspicious that George Dyson
should come on the scene, and
somehow Thomas Bartlett would redraft
his
entire will, in that not only would
Adelaide
inherit, but she was now also allowed to
remarry and basically do whatever she
wanted.
And that also happened just four months
before he died,
so for me that's like a red flag. I
concur.


The doctor that was treating Thomas
Bartlett was Dr Alfred Leach,
and leach said that he prescribed
chloroform
reluctantly, but that Thomas
insisted on that. Which is also
a bit strange, but I guess like if he
couldn't
get to sleep, at some point you get
desperate.
So I think it's important to note here,
that at the time chloroform
was like a seen as a miracle drug.
It had recently come onto the scene, a
lot of
different countries and practitioners
have used chloroform as the perfect
anesthetic,
the perfect drug that would send you to
sleep,
so it was it was widely used throughout
continental europe for both pain relief
and as an analgesic. So
to ask your practitioner to prescribe
you chloroform in those times
was less questionable than it would be
in today's economy. Just like
if I were have to been alive at that
time they would have prescribed me
cocaine... and morphine... and vaginal stimulus.
Well we went, we went different ways with
that.


The mystery around the pimlico mystery
is that Adelaide
and Dyson was put on trial, but
mostly Adelaide,
for poisoning him, Thomas Bartlett,
because at the autopsy they discovered
a lethal dose of chloroform in his
stomach.
But the mystery of it is that he didn't
have
abrasions in his throat or
mouth. Like if he had
swallowed chloroform there would have
been like,
wear I guess? Yeah so chloroform
is a nasty liquid to administer
through the digestive tract, and
quite often medics will see
that liquid chloroform
will cause a lot of problems.
So one article that was in the BMJ
was of someone that tried to overdose
with 99% chloroform
in liquid form, so they admitted that one
particular lady into AE and she had
a hepatotoxicity, which is
liver failure she had severe gastritis
and ulceration,
she had severe enterocolitis which is
inflammatory
of the digestive tract and the colon,
she had erosive esophagitis,
and she also had dermal secretions
of the chloroform. So the question
of the pimlico murders is how
Adelaide managed to administer
a lethal dose of liquid chloroform, which
was confirmed in the autopsy,
but yet how Thomas Bartlett
had no signs of the corrosion
or the burning. And the erosion
of his esophagus or his intestinal tract
from that chloroform. But what I
wonder is like, how much do you
digest chloroform?
Chloroform in itself is a well-absorbed
metabolite,
it's quickly metabolized and eliminated
within
the body. Okay so it could have been, it
couldn't have been like a
poisoning throughout a couple of months
because then
that's... No definitely not.
So a couple of studies that are quoted
in wikipedia have got
a half-life of chloroform at 6.5
hours, so that means that if you had
a 10 milliliter dose
within six and a half hours that would
have been metabolized down to a five
milliliter dose. So it's
really quickly absorbed, and also
it's interesting to note that in the
autopsy
they only found six to eight
drops of pure chloroform
in the stomach. But they did also find
ulceration in the colon,
which would suggest that it was
administered
orally and absorbed in the time frame
between when it was administered and
when it was reported by Adelaide.
Which was supposedly a three-hour
difference.
Oh only a three-hour difference? Yeah
he went to bed and then in the morning
she called
the landlord. Sources vary,
but from what I've read, it was a around
three to four
hours later that she reported
to her landlord that her husband was
dead. Okay,
all right, when I first read about this
case
I thought that well if you needed to
administer
a poison, well needed is... obviously
she didn't need to, but you know, and
there were no like signs of it in the
mouth
or the throat, I thought maybe she
injected it in something that he would
swallow whole
without chewing but then I also realized
there's not many food things that you
would swallow a hole
without chewing. And that raises the
interesting point
as to how significant
thomas's dental treatment was and he was
regularly seeing
dentists and doctors regarding that
and at the time chloroform was given
as an analgesic as a as a pain relief
so it's it's quite possible that
in a combination of his
remedial chloroform use as
analgesic that the coroners
whilst performing an autopsy wouldn't be
able to pick up
the same kind of corrosion from
chloroform
overdose that they would have done from
a patient
that hadn't administered chloroform
orally
okay so there might have been damage to
his mouth
they found chloroform in its pure liquid
form in his stomach
so you would have expected uh
gastrointestinal
damage but if he was already
administering chloroform orally to
inhale
to help him sleep and we know that he
was given it to rub into his gums
it's possible that the damage that would
have been caused by either inhalation or
him rubbing it into his gums
could have uh masked the damage that
would have been
seen through a toxic dose
of chloroform being administered to him
so you you're saying is that with the
technical know-how that they had at the
time they wouldn't have
been able to prove that because of his
already
damaged mouth well there's there's a
couple of theories
as to how he died and I think
the one that lends the most reliability
sort of coincides with with what
adelaide
told the prosecution so um
she told them that she had been using
chloroform to help thomas get to sleep
so she'd been in dabbing it onto a
napkin
and letting him inhale it
and she followed that up once
she'd realized that she had administered
a lethal dose she offered him brandy
which obviously has the burning and
fiery taste that is associated
with chloroform so if you if you ingest
chloroform
it's obviously going to burn your
esophagus it's quite a
similar sensation to drinking
neat spirit bits so adelaide could
quite easily have disguised drinking
brandy
as a correlation between administering
chloroform
to him. So what you're saying is that
it's not a mystery,
she just put the chloroform in the wine? There's
no way to prove it
but in combination between the pubmed
and
the bmj article that I read the sequence
of events
was that she used a chloroform
rag to help him get to sleep to aid
with his dental problems she then
offered him
brandy which as aforementioned has the
burning and fiery taste
she then could have it's not proven that
she could have
added the chloroform to a glass of wine
which was found on the mantelpiece
within
reach of thomas edwin bartlett
so if she added that chloroform to the
wine
as he drank it it could have also
passed through his esophagus with the
burning sensation that he would have
associated with brandy
and the pre-administered aspiration
of the chloroform would have made him
drowsy and a bit
sleepy so he wouldn't have been 100 %
aware of what's happening so you drink
one drink
it burns on the way down you think okay
that's fine
you drink another drink it burns on the
way down
you think okay that's fine it's the same
drink
you combine that with the bad condition
of his mouth
and also it's well documented
that she said when she found him
unconscious
she poured brandy down his mouth to try
and rouse him
which could also be seen as an attempt
to mask the smell of chloroform
which is particularly sweet and so
in my opinion it's quite likely that she
spiked one of his drinks with the lethal
dose of chloroform
and the combination of that with his
previous
dental treatment explains
why he didn't have the conditions
coroners would have suspected
because they were looking for damage and
erosion to the gi tract but if he was
already
self-administering chloroform as
an analgesic you would expect some
level of that gi damage to have
been in place already so more or less
it is definitely possible that she
poisoned him
with a drink and then poured more drink
or he swallowed more liquids and
the traces in the esophagus and the
mouth that should have been there wasn't
there because he had swallowed
other liquids yeah absolutely yeah i
think
the dilution effect of the white
would have eased the conditions
of the corrosion and the damage
to the gi tract so more or less
the pimlico mystery isn't actually a
mystery anymore
well it's hypothetical I wouldn't like
to criticize
the coroners at the time um
the coroners were were crown prosecution
coroners
hold for applause
\[Laughter] excuse us listeners we're pissed
it's the only way we can get over our
social anxiety
\[Music] I'm so sweaty
\[Laughter] but I think at the time there wasn't the
science available
to determine the administration route
and that's what got adelaide off.
Because also, the landlord found
a bottle and they found that it smelled
of brandy and some kind of
ether. Ether has a typically sweet smell
so they wouldn't have immediately
identified it as chloroform.
But the fact that chloroform was readily
available as prescription
and that george dyson had
suspicious circumstances in purchasing
the chloroform leads towards the guilty
prosecution of agile age
but obviously without being able to
autopsy
and determine stomach contents
and body condition and things like that
it will forever remain a mystery
but also like looking back on it now
reverend dyson said that oh I didn't
realize
how suspicious this was
until after I did it like
buying the bottles of small amounts of
chloroform from
four different uh shops and stuff like
that and I'm like oh
it smells like ether to me! No, I mean
like,
it smells like pre-meditative murder to
me!


The laws at the time said that
you only had to sign for and put a
record down
for volumes of chloroform that were
high volume but if you had been
told by someone to buy
x amount of chloroform and you then
went about it and went to all of these
different chemists
and suppliers and bought a volume
below the level that you needed to
supply
a reasoning and a signature it
does become slightly suspicious and then
you tie that into the fact
that thomas had changed his will
yeah not long after meeting
the vicar he was basically courting them
he was allowing them to meet he didn't
mind their relationship
they could kiss in his presence while he
was smoking a pipe in
the corner of the room but I don't think
he
did actually allow them to do that i
think that was
like a rewrite of history from adelaide
and george dyson because it's like well
they said that that was the case which
then begs even more questions
as to why he changed his will I think
that they probably persuaded him
to take that like clause out
of the will maybe when he was already
drugged.
Yeah. 

And after that, after the whole
shebang, she was acquitted by the way
because they didn't have enough
evidence. She was also acquitted under a statement to say that there's
quite overwhelming evidence
to suggest that she had done it, they
just
couldn't prove how it had been
administered without
causing the damage that they would
expect
through oral administration.
Did you feel like you solved it? No,
I think it will always remain unsolved
until someone looks at 
how easy it is to administer liquid
chloroform
through some kind of diluent. It has to
be
possible, right? Anything's
possible. So follow your dreams.
Oh, I did have a question. Are you
gonna do a trailer
for every podcast, or was it just a
trailer
for us in general? It's a trailer for us
in general.
Okay. But I might change it if I have
something
better... If I had
any shit to work with. 
That's fine, I was just curious. Curious. All right let's get on
with this shit.
Okay, should we say bye to the bots?
Sure, why not. Goodbye bots! Is
this because we talked about the russian
government last time, that we have so
many bot downloads?
So many. It's, it's quite possible.
Bye russian bots! Hello russia!
