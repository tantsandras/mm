  listener discretion is advised
  crystal is clanking!
  I've opted for uh glenmoray single malt
  18 pounds from tesco, other
  retailers are available. Well somebody is

  it's father's day in the uk tomorrow and
  i hadn't got my dad anything
  hmm what are you gonna get him i got him
  some dessert flavored chocolates
  and a fancy bottle of
  birra morate which i think is an italian
  brand of beer
  i'm not sure these continental europeans
  it's post-brexit i don't care about them

  what is oh my god
  he answered you but not me
  but do you want to get out
  i walked into the radiator on my way
  back
  smooth smooth as
  caramel oh smooth after that
  whiskey you bought from tesco for 18
  pounds it's actually pretty nice
  will you tell budo to shut up she's
  introducing a lot of background noise
  i think she wants dinner she is very
  much
  wanting to be in this room but when
  she's in she's like i can't get out i
  can't get up
  what did you do to me i was like you did

  [Laughter]
  okay should we start i've been waiting
  for you to start
  for 15 minutes
  oh god play the jingle
  it worked last time
  you're listening to midweek murders
  and it's time to talk about crime
  that's what i'm talking about do the
  introductions
  oh my god no i'm sandra
  and this is my friend joe say hi to
  hi joe oh i knew you were gonna go for
  that one
  hanging through
  on today's episode on today's episode
  [Laughter]
  sorry sorry you're doing great
  we're good
  okay i'm ready today we're gonna talk
  about the pimlico mystery
  so our case starts on
  the 1st of january 1886
  when adelaide adelaide
  atlanta adelaide
  you know like the place
  [Laughter]
  i actually practiced her name
  like by myself on the toilet when i was
  pooping a lot of times
  before we had this car they still can't
  sit
  you should probably cut the pooping part
  out
  adelaide adelaide yeah okay
  i'm gonna like the place in america
  is that a place in america yeah it is
  the case we're gonna talk about today is
  the pimlico mystery
  and it started the first of january
  1886 when
  adelaide called her landlord to say
  come down i think miss mr bartlett is
  dead
  and mr bartlett was thomas edwin
  bartlett
  her husband
  that's the one she married thomas edwin
  bartlett when she was 19 and he was
  29. still younger than i am right now
  oh yeah
  and thomas edwin bartlett had been
  diagnosed with
  subacute gastritis a couple of weeks
  before
  he was poisoned i think what is
  sub-acute gastritis
  you know so gastritis
  is the inflammation
  of the gastric system so it's like
  your abdominals and
  your stomach and places like that
  and inflammation is that like ibs or is
  it
  it could be yeah so um it's it's a
  general medical term
  to encompass an entire range
  of inflammatory diseases so it could be
  ibs
  it could be inflammatory bowel disease
  i'm pretty sure that's what ibs is yeah
  i was just gonna say irritable bowel
  syndrome
  i think it's sad for so they married
  kind of ten years before in 1875
  their friend or spiritual guide
  or spiritual counsel and
  a five-time winner of witch weekly's
  most charming
  smile award
  [Laughter]
  reverend george dyson had
  bought the chloroform at four different
  stores
  in such a small capacity that he didn't
  have to
  sign his name and the
  product that he bought because if he had
  bought
  the same amount of chloroform at one
  store
  wait shit i should have said where i got
  my
  well i can say it now i got my research
  from
  murderpedia.org
  whereas i got my information from
  uh wikipedia and
  a pubmed article published by
  duchenne jayawira at al that was
  probably about
  seven different authors and uh
  the bmj which was authored by an
  m farrell oh
  you did so much more research than i did
  yeah like three times as many sources
  yeah something i think it's important to
  mention that
  uh thomas edwin bartlett had a history
  of
  conditions that he was being treated for
  so he had um several teeth removed
  he had his teeth filed down into stumps
  and it was well documented by adelaide
  that their relationship was
  non-sexual because of his
  foul aroma oh
  did she actually say that i'm not sure
  if those are her exact
  words but it i think it was mentioned in
  her trial that they
  they didn't uh regularly consummate
  their marriage
  because she was off put by the smell
  from his mouth
  well one thing's for sure he was not
  a five-time witch weekly most charming
  smile award winner she he's no gilderoy
  lockhart let's put it that way
  to be honest i never fancied gilderola
  card did you
  no but i am susceptible to a nice set of
  teeth
  well adelaide probably was as well
  yeah and that's why they never boned
  but they did though i read that uh
  she did have a baby fathered by
  thomas that was still born i think wait
  yes it was uh delivered
  unfortunately deceased
  and thomas bartlett was very reluctant
  to have any kind of medical help
  in that delivery whether that's any
  significance to his character or the
  case at all
  remains to be determined
  i did i did read that he had said
  during the delivery that he didn't want
  a doctor's help because he didn't want
  another man
  interfering with her which is curious
  because she said that she was encouraged
  to have a relationship
  with um george dyson the
  minister yeah so yeah the sources that i
  read
  uh also confirmed that they were
  encouraged to have a relationship in so
  much as that he didn't
  mind them kissing in front of him
  but that's what they said wasn't it yeah
  that was uh the opinion of adelaide
  and george yeah so
  adelaide blonde de la creme
  married him as i said when she was 19
  and he came from a very close-knit
  family
  of prosperous grocers and
  some sources say that she well some
  sources i only read the murder pedia so
  what do i know
  but it's like difference in opinion i
  think
  about like how much they
  accepted her into the family which
  doesn't obviously make
  any difference to what happened in the
  end
  but her father-in-law accused her of
  having a sexual relationship
  with thomas's younger brother
  yes yeah that's seconded
  in the sources that i read yeah so the
  the father-in-law was a
  a particularly strong voice
  against their relationship
  which of course is hard to say anything
  about
  because it was so long ago but
  might have been might have not have been
  thomas bartlett
  had drafted a will before he fell
  acutely ill
  as it seemed leaving everything to
  adelaide and there was a stipulation in
  that world seeing that
  she couldn't remarry if she had
  inherited his estate
  but then they redrew the will
  or he redrew the will and made george
  dyson an executor of that will
  and removed the bar
  where it said that adelaide couldn't
  remarry
  and that for me also indicates murder
  it's quite suspicious that george dyson
  should come on the scene and
  somehow thomas bartlett would redraft
  his
  entire will in that not only would
  adelaide
  inherit but she was now also allowed to
  remarry and basically do whatever she
  wanted
  and that also happened just four months
  before he died
  so for me that's like a red flag i
  concur
  the doctor that was treating thomas
  bartlett was dr alfred leach
  and leach said that he prescribed
  chloroform
  reluctantly but that thomas
  insisted on that which is also
  a bit strange but i guess like if he
  couldn't
  get to sleep at some point you get
  desperate
  so i think it's important to note here
  that at the time chloroform
  was like a seen as a miracle drug
  it had recently come onto the scene a
  lot of
  different countries and practitioners
  have used chloroform as the perfect
  anesthetic
  the perfect drug that would send you to
  sleep
  so it was it was widely used throughout
  continental europe for both pain relief
  and as an analgesic so
  to ask your practitioner to prescribe
  you chloroform in those times
  was less questionable than it would be
  in today's economy just like
  if i were have to been alive at that
  time they would have prescribed me
  cocaine and vaginal stimulus
  well we went we went different ways with
  that
  the mystery around the pimlico mystery
  is that adelaide
  and dyson was put on trial would but
  mostly adelaide
  for poisoning him thomas bartlett
  because at the autopsy they discovered
  a lethal dose of chloroform in his
  stomach
  but the mystery of it is that he didn't
  have
  abrasions in his throat or
  mouth like if he had
  swallowed chloroform there would have
  been like
  wear i guess yeah so chloroform
  is a nasty liquid to administer
  through the digestive tract and
  quite often uh medics will see
  that liquid chloroform
  will cause a lot of problems
  so one article that was in the bmj
  was of someone that tried to overdose
  with 99 chloroform
  in liquid form so they admitted that one
  particular lady into a e and she had
  a hepatotoxicity which is
  liver failure she had severe gastritis
  and ulceration
  she had severe enterocolitis which is
  inflammatory
  of the digestive tract and the colon
  she had erosive esophagitis
  and she also had dermal secretions
  of the chloroform so the question
  of the pimlico murders is how
  adelaide managed to administer
  a lethal dose of liquid chloroform which
  was confirmed in the autopsy
  but yet how thomas bartlett
  had no signs of the corrosion
  or the burning and the erosion
  of his esophagus or his intestinal tract
  from that chloroform but what i
  wonder is like how much do you
  digest chloroform
  chloroform in itself is a well-absorbed
  metabolite
  it's quickly metabolized and eliminated
  within
  the body okay so it could have been it
  couldn't have been like a
  poisoning throughout a couple of months
  because then
  that's no definitely not so
  so a couple of studies that are quoted
  in wikipedia have got
  a half-life of chloroform at 6.5
  hours so that means that if you had
  a 10 milliliter dose
  within six and a half hours that would
  have been metabolized down to a five
  milligram
  uh milliliter dose so it's
  really quickly absorbed and also
  it's interesting to note that in the
  autopsy
  they only found six to eight
  drops of pure chloroform
  in the stomach but they did also find
  ulceration in the colon
  which would suggest that it was
  administered
  orally and absorbed in the time frame
  between when it was administered and
  when it was reported by adelaide
  which was supposedly a three-hour
  difference
  oh only a three-hour difference yeah
  he went to bed and then in the morning
  she called
  the landlord sources vary
  but from what i've read it was a around
  three to four
  hours later that she reported
  to her landlord that her husband was
  dead okay
  all right when i first read about this
  case
  i thought that well if you needed to
  administer
  a poison well needed is obviously
  she didn't need to but you know and
  there were no like signs of it in the
  mouth
  or the throat i thought maybe she
  injected it in something that he would
  swallow whole
  without chewing but then i also realized
  there's not many food things that you
  would swallow a hole
  without chewing and that raises the
  interesting point
  as to how significant
  thomas's dental treatment was and he was
  regularly seeing
  dentists and doctors regarding that
  and at the time chloroform was given
  as an analgesic as a as a pain relief
  so it's it's quite possible that
  in a combination of his
  remedial chloroform use as
  analgesic that the coroners
  whilst performing an autopsy wouldn't be
  able to pick up
  the same kind of corrosion from
  chloroform
  overdose that they would have done from
  a patient
  that hadn't administered chloroform
  orally
  okay so there might have been damage to
  his mouth
  they found chloroform in its pure liquid
  form in his stomach
  so you would have expected uh
  gastrointestinal
  damage but if he was already
  administering chloroform orally to
  inhale
  to help him sleep and we know that he
  was given it to rub into his gums
  it's possible that the damage that would
  have been caused by either inhalation or
  him rubbing it into his gums
  could have uh masked the damage that
  would have been
  seen through a toxic dose
  of chloroform being administered to him
  so you you're saying is that with the
  technical know-how that they had at the
  time they wouldn't have
  been able to prove that because of his
  already
  damaged mouth well there's there's a
  couple of theories
  as to how he died and i think
  the one that lends the most reliability
  sort of coincides with with what
  adelaide
  told the prosecution so um
  she told them that she had been using
  chloroform to help thomas get to sleep
  so she'd been in dabbing it onto a
  napkin
  and letting him inhale it
  and she followed that up once
  she'd realized that she had administered
  a lethal dose she offered him brandy
  which obviously has the burning and
  fiery taste that is associated
  with chloroform so if you if you ingest
  chloroform
  it's obviously going to burn your
  esophagus it's quite a
  similar sensation to drinking
  neat spirit bits so adelaide could
  quite easily have disguised drinking
  brandy
  as a correlation between administering
  chloroform
  to him so what you're saying is that
  it's not a mystery
  she just put the chloroform in there's
  no way to prove it
  but in combination between the pubmed
  and
  the bmj article that i read the sequence
  of events
  was that she used a chloroform
  rag to help him get to sleep to aid
  with his dental problems she then
  offered him
  brandy which as aforementioned has the
  burning and fiery taste
  she then could have it's not proven that
  she could have
  added the chloroform to a glass of wine
  which was found on the mantelpiece
  within
  reach of thomas edwin bartlett
  so if she added that chloroform to the
  wine
  as he drank it it could have also
  passed through his esophagus with the
  burning sensation that he would have
  associated with brandy
  and the pre-administered aspiration
  of the chloroform would have made him
  drowsy and a bit
  sleepy so he wouldn't have been 100
  aware of what's happening so you drink
  one drink
  it burns on the way down you think okay
  that's fine
  you drink another drink it burns on the
  way down
  you think okay that's fine it's the same
  drink
  you combine that with the bad condition
  of his mouth
  and also it's well documented
  that she said when she found him
  unconscious
  she poured brandy down his mouth to try
  and rouse him
  which could also be seen as an attempt
  to mask the smell of chloroform
  which is particularly sweet and so
  in my opinion it's quite likely that she
  spiked one of his drinks with the lethal
  dose of chloroform
  and the combination of that with his
  previous
  dental treatment explains
  why he didn't have the conditions
  coroners would have suspected
  because they were looking for damage and
  erosion to the gi tract but if he was
  already
  self-administering chloroform as
  an analgesic you would expect some
  level of that gi damage to have
  been in place already so more or less
  it is definitely possible that she
  poisoned him
  with a drink and then poured more drink
  or he swallowed more liquids and
  the traces in the esophagus and the
  mouth that should have been there wasn't
  there because he had swallowed
  other liquids yeah absolutely yeah i
  think
  the dilution effect of the white
  would have eased the conditions
  of the corrosion and the damage
  to the gi tract so more or less
  the pimlico mystery isn't actually a
  mystery anymore
  well it's hypothetical i wouldn't like
  to criticize
  the coroners at the time um
  the coroners were were crown prosecution
  coroners
  hold for applause
  [Laughter]
  excuse us listeners we're pissed
  it's the only way we can get over our
  social anxiety
  [Music]
  i'm so sweaty
  [Laughter]
  but i think at the time there wasn't the
  science available
  to determine the administration route
  and that's what got adelaide off
  because also the landlords found
  a bottle and they found that it smelled
  of brandy and some kind of
  ether ether has a typically sweet smell
  so they wouldn't have immediately
  identified it as chloroform
  but the fact that chloroform was readily
  available as prescription
  and that george dyson had
  suspicious circumstances in purchasing
  the chloroform leads towards the guilty
  prosecution of agile age
  but obviously without being able to
  autopsy
  and determine stomach contents
  and body condition and things like that
  it will forever remain a mystery
  but also like looking back on it now
  reverend dyson said that oh i didn't
  realize
  how suspicious this was
  until after i did it like
  buying the bottles of small amounts of
  chloroform from
  four different uh shops and stuff like
  that and i'm like oh
  it smells like ether to me no i mean
  like
  it smells like pre-meditative murder to
  me
  the laws at the time said that
  you only had to sign for and put a
  record down
  for volumes of chloroform that were
  high volume but if you had been
  told by someone to buy
  x amount of chloroform and you then
  went about it and went to all of these
  different chemists
  and suppliers and bought a volume
  below the level that you needed to
  supply
  a reasoning and a signature it
  does become slightly suspicious and then
  you tie that into the fact
  that thomas had changed his will
  yeah not long after meeting
  the vicar he was basically courting them
  he was allowing them to meet he didn't
  mind their relationship
  they could kiss in his presence while he
  was smoking a pipe in
  the corner of the room but i don't think
  he
  did actually allow them to do that i
  think that was
  like a rewrite of history from adelaide
  and george dyson because it's like well
  they said that that was the case which
  then begs even more questions
  as to why he changed his will i think
  that they probably persuaded him
  to take that like clause out
  of the will maybe when he was already
  drugged
  yeah and after that after the whole
  shebang she was acquitted by the way
  because they didn't have enough
  evidence she was also acquitted under
  um a statement to say that there's
  there's
  quite overwhelming evidence
  to suggest that she had done it they
  just
  couldn't prove how it had been
  administered without
  causing the damage that they would
  expect
  through oral administration
  did you feel like you solved it no
  i think it will always remain unsolved
  until someone looks at uh
  how easy it is to administer liquid
  chloroform
  through some kind of diluent it has to
  be
  possible right everything's
  possible so follow your dreams
  oh i did have a question um are you
  gonna do a trailer
  for every podcast or was it just a
  trailer
  for us in general it's a trailer for us
  in general
  okay but i might change it if i have
  something
  better if i have
  any shit to work with
  this is fine i was just curious
  and curious uh all right let's get on
  with this shit
  okay should we say bye to the bolts
  sure why not goodbye bots is
  it because we talked about the russian
  government last time that we have so
  many bought downloads
  so many it's it's quite possible
  bye russian bots hello russia
