#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.


Oh! Oh ho hoo!
Crystal is clanking!


I've opted for uh glenmoray single malt
18 pounds from tesco, other
retailers are available. 

Well somebody is
living life. 

Yeah.
Well, I had to go to the shops because
it's father's day in the UK tomorrow and
I hadn't got my dad anything.


What are you gonna get him?

I got him
some dessert flavored chocolates
and a fancy bottle of
birra morate, which I think is an italian
brand of beer. I'm not sure. These continental europeans,
it's post-brexit I don't care about them.


That would have been a good opening of
the episode.
People are gonna kill us for that, no
they aren't,
because nobody listens.


Um, we had 47 bots
download our podcast thank you very much.


True story. 

Of which I would like to
express
my eternal gratitude. Thank you 
the programmers who have created a bot
to download
any old kind of shit from the internet.
\[Music] 

Bodil broke into...It was very funny, she broke into the bedroom
very decisively... 

Oh, I heard that!


You can't come here and just scream at
me,
what is the point?! Oh god, no, she can't
get out.
What is.. 

Kom d√• Bodil!

Oh my god,
she answered you but not me.
Bodil, do you want to get out?
I walked into the radiator on my way
back.


Smooth. 

Smooth as
caramel. Or smooth as that
whiskey you bought from tesco for 18
pounds. 

It's actually pretty nice.
Will you tell Bodil to shut up? She's
introducing a lot of background noise.


I think she wants dinner. She is very
much
wanting to be in this room but when
she's in, she's like: "I can't get out, I
can't get out.
What did you do to me?" I was like: "you did
this to yourself".


I know that feeling it's every time we
press record.
\[Laughter] 

Am I holding you hostage in our friendship? \[Laughter] 

Okay should we start? 

I've been waiting for you to start
for 15 minutes.


Oh god. 

Play the jingle.
It worked last time.


You're listening to Midweek Murders,
and it's time to talk about crime.


That's what I'm talking about! Do the
introductions!


Oh my god, nooo. I'm Sandra
and this is my friend Joe. Say hi Joe.


Hi Joe. 

Oh I knew you were gonna go for
that one, low
hanging fruit.
On today's episode \[get's interrupted again], on today's episode. \[Laughter] 

Sorry, sorry you're doing great. 

Wikiwikiwah...pedia.


Okay I'm ready. 

Today we're gonna talk
about the pimlico mystery.
So our case starts on
the 1st of january 1886
when Adelaide... 

ADELAIDE!
Adelaide,
you know like the place.
\[Laughter] 

I actually practiced her name by myself on the toilet when I was
pooping. A lot of times
before we had this call, and I still can't
say it. 


You should probably cut the pooping part
out.


Adelaide. 

Adelaide, yeah...


I'm gonna... 

Like the place in america.


Is that a place in america? 

Yeah it is.


The case we're gonna talk about today is
the pimlico mystery,
and it started the first of january
1886 when
Adelaide called her landlord to say:
"come down I think miss Mr Bartlett is
dead"
and Mr Bartlett was Thomas Edwin
Bartlett.
Her... 

Husband.


That's the one. She married Thomas Edwin
Bartlett when she was 19 and he was 29. Still younger than I am right now. 

Oh yeah.


And Thomas Edwin Bartlett had been
diagnosed with
subacute gastritis a couple of weeks
before
he was poisoned, I think. What is
sub-acute gastritis?


You know so gastritis
is the inflammation
of the gastric system so it's like
your abdominals, and
your stomach, and places like that.


And inflammation is that like IBS or is
it...


It could be yeah, so it's a
general medical term
to encompass an entire range
of inflammatory diseases. So it could be
IBS,
it could be inflammatory bowel disease.
I'm pretty sure that's what IBS is. 

Yeah,
I was just gonna say. Irritable bowel
syndrome,
I think it stands for. So they married
kind of ten years before in 1875.
Their friend, or spiritual guide,
or spiritual counsel, and five-time winner of witch weekly's
most charming
smile award
\[Laughter] reverend George Dyson had bought the chloroform at four different
stores,
in such a small capacity that he didn't
have to
sign his name. And the
product that he bought, because if he had
bought
the same amount of chloroform at one
store...
Wait, shit, I should have said where I got
my...
Well I can say it now. I got my research
from
murderpedia.org.


Whereas I got my information from
wikipedia and
a pubmed article published by Dushan Jayaweera[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27788591/#affiliation-1), that was
probably about
seven different authors. And
the BMJ, which was authored by an
M. Farrell. 

Oh.
You did so much more research than I did.


Yeah like three times as many sources. I think it's important to mention that Thomas Edwin Bartlett had a history
of conditions that he was being treated for.
So he had several teeth removed,
he had his teeth filed down into stumps,
and it was well documented by Adelaide
that their relationship was
non-sexual because of his
foul aroma. 

Oh.
Did she actually say that? 

I'm not sure
if those are her exact
words, but it I think it was mentioned in
her trial that they
didn't regularly consummate
their marriage
because she was off put by the smell
from his mouth.


Well one thing's for sure, he was not
a five-time witch weekly most charming
smile award winner. 

He's no gilderoy
lockhart let's put it that way.


To be honest, I never fancied gilderoy 
Lockhart, did you?


No, but I am susceptible to a nice set of teeth.


Well Adelaide probably was as well.


Yeah, and that's why they never boned.


But they did though, I read that
she did have a baby fathered by
Thomas that was still born, I think. Wait...


Yes it was delivered
unfortunately deceased.
And Thomas Bartlett was very reluctant
to have any kind of medical help
in that delivery, whether that's any
significance to his character or the
case at all
remains to be determined.


I did read that he had said
during the delivery that he didn't want
a doctor's help because he didn't want
another man
interfering with her, which is curious
because she said that she was encouraged
to have a relationship
with George Dyson, the
minister. 

Yeah. So the sources that I
read also confirmed that they were
encouraged to have a relationship in so
much as that he didn't
mind them kissing in front of him.


But that's what they said, wasn't it? 

Yeah
that was the opinion of Adelaide
and George. 

Yeah. So
Adelaide Blanche de la Tremoille
married him, as I said when she was 19,
and he came from a very close-knit
family
of prosperous grocers and
some sources say that she, well I say some
sources, I only read the murderpedia so
what do I know.
But it's like difference in opinion I
think,
about like how much they
accepted her into the family. Which
doesn't obviously make
any difference to what happened in the
end,
but her father-in-law accused her of
having a sexual relationship
with Thomas's younger brother.


Yes, yeah, that's seconded
in the sources that I read. So the
the father-in-law was a
a particularly strong voice
against their relationship.


Which, of course, is hard to say anything
about
because it was so long ago, but
might have been might have not have been.
Thomas Bartlett
had drafted a will before he fell
acutely ill,
as it seemed leaving everything to
Adelaide and there was a stipulation in
that will, saying that
she couldn't remarry if she had
inherited his estate.
But then they redrew the will,
or he redrew the will, and made George
Dyson an executor of that will,
and removed the bar
where it said that Adelaide couldn't
remarry.
And that, for me, also indicates murder.


It's quite suspicious that George Dyson
should come on the scene, and
somehow Thomas Bartlett would redraft
his
entire will, in that not only would
Adelaide
inherit, but she was now also allowed to
remarry and basically do whatever she
wanted.


And that also happened just four months
before he died,
so for me that's like a red flag. 

I concur.

The doctor that was treating Thomas Bartlett was Dr Alfred Leach,
and Leach said that he prescribed
chloroform
reluctantly, but that Thomas
insisted on that. Which is also
a bit strange, but I guess like if he
couldn't
get to sleep, at some point you get
desperate.


So I think it's important to note here,
that at the time chloroform
was like a seen as a miracle drug.
It had recently come onto the scene, a
lot of
different countries and practitioners
have used chloroform as the perfect
anesthetic,
the perfect drug that would send you to
sleep,
so it was it was widely used throughout
continental europe for both pain relief
and as an analgesic. So
to ask your practitioner to prescribe
you chloroform in those times
was less questionable than it would be
in today's economy. 

Just like
if I were have to been alive at that
time they would have prescribed me
cocaine... 

and morphine... 

and vaginal stimulus.


Well we went, we went different ways with
that.

The mystery around the pimlico mystery is that Adelaide
and Dyson was put on trial, but
mostly Adelaide,
for poisoning him, Thomas Bartlett,
because at the autopsy they discovered
a lethal dose of chloroform in his
stomach.
But the mystery of it is that he didn't
have
abrasions in his throat or
mouth. Like if he had
swallowed chloroform there would have
been like,
wear I guess? 

Yeah so chloroform
is a nasty liquid to administer
through the digestive tract, and
quite often medics will see
that liquid chloroform
will cause a lot of problems.
So one article that was in the BMJ
was of someone that tried to overdose
with 99% chloroform
in liquid form, so they admitted that one
particular lady into AE and she had
a hepatotoxicity, which is
liver failure she had severe gastritis
and ulceration,
she had severe enterocolitis which is
inflammatory
of the digestive tract and the colon,
she had erosive esophagitis,
and she also had dermal secretions
of the chloroform. So the question
of the pimlico murder is how
Adelaide managed to administer
a lethal dose of liquid chloroform, which
was confirmed in the autopsy,
but yet how Thomas Bartlett
had no signs of the corrosion
or the burning. And the erosion
of his esophagus or his intestinal tract
from that chloroform. 

But what I
wonder is like, how much do you
digest chloroform?


Chloroform in itself is a well-absorbed
metabolite,
it's quickly metabolized and eliminated
within
the body. 

Okay so it could have been... It
couldn't have been like a
poisoning throughout a couple of months
because then
that's... 

No definitely not.
So a couple of studies that are quoted
in wikipedia have got
a half-life of chloroform at 6.5
hours, so that means that if you had
a 10 milliliter dose
within six and a half hours that would
have been metabolized down to a five
milliliter dose. So it's
really quickly absorbed, and also
it's interesting to note that in the
autopsy,
they only found six to eight
drops of pure chloroform
in the stomach. But they did also find
ulceration in the colon,
which would suggest that it was
administered
orally and absorbed in the time frame
between when it was administered and
when it was reported by Adelaide.
Which was supposedly a three-hour
difference.


Oh only a three-hour difference? 

Yeah.
He went to bed and then in the morning
she called
the landlord. Sources vary,
but from what I've read, it was a around
three to four
hours later that she reported
to her landlord that her husband was
dead. 

Okay,
all right, when I first read about this
case
I thought that well if you needed to
administer
a poison, well needed is... Obviously,
she didn't need to, but you know. And
there were no like signs of it in the
mouth
or the throat, I thought maybe she
injected it in something that he would
swallow whole
without chewing but then I also realized
there's not many food things that you
would swallow whole
without chewing. 

And that raises the
interesting point
as to how significant
Thomas' dental treatment was, and he was
regularly seeing
dentists and doctors regarding that.
And at the time chloroform was given
as an analgesic, as a pain relief.
So it's quite possible that,
in a combination of his
remedial chloroform use as
analgesic, that the coroners
whilst performing an autopsy wouldn't be
able to pick up
the same kind of corrosion from
chloroform
overdose that they would have done from
a patient
that hadn't administered chloroform
orally.


Okay. So there might have been damage to
his mouth?


They found chloroform in its pure liquid
form in his stomach,
so you would have expected gastrointestinal
damage. But if he was already
administering chloroform orally to
inhale,
to help him sleep, and we know that he
was given it to rub into his gums,
it's possible that the damage that would
have been caused by either inhalation or
him rubbing it into his gums
could have masked the damage that
would have been
seen through a toxic dose
of chloroform being administered to him.


So you you're saying is that with the
technical know-how that they had at the
time, they wouldn't have
been able to prove that because of his
already
damaged mouth? 

Well there's a
couple of theories
as to how he died, and I think
the one that lends the most reliability
sort of coincides with what
Adelaide
told the prosecution. So she told them that she had been using
chloroform to help Thomas get to sleep,
so she'd been in dabbing it onto a
napkin
and letting him inhale it,
and she followed that up once
she'd realized that she had administered
a lethal dose, she offered him brandy
which obviously has the burning and
fiery taste that is associated
with chloroform. So if you ingest
chloroform
it's obviously going to burn your
esophagus, it's quite a
similar sensation to drinking
neat spirits. So Adelaide could
quite easily have disguised drinking
brandy
as a correlation between administering
chloroform
to him. 

So what you're saying is that
it's not a mystery,
she just put the chloroform in the brandy? 

There's
no way to prove it,
but in combination between the pubmed
and
the BMJ article that I read, the sequence
of events
was that she used a chloroform
rag to help him get to sleep to aid
with his dental problems. She then
offered him
brandy, which as aforementioned has the
burning and fiery taste.
She then could have, it's not proven, but
she could have
added the chloroform to a glass of wine
which was found on the mantelpiece
within
reach of Thomas Edwin Bartlett.
So if she added that chloroform to the
wine,
as he drank it it could have also
passed through his esophagus with the
burning sensation that he would have
associated with brandy,
and the pre-administered aspiration
of the chloroform would have made him
drowsy and a bit
sleepy. So he wouldn't have been 100%
aware of what's happening. So you drink
one drink,
it burns on the way down, you think: "okay,
that's fine".
You drink another drink, it burns on the
way down,
you think: "okay, that's fine, it's the same
drink".
You combine that with the bad condition
of his mouth,
and also it's well documented
that she said when she found him
unconscious
she poured brandy down his mouth to try
and rouse him,
which could also be seen as an attempt
to mask the smell of chloroform
which is particularly sweet. And so
in my opinion, it's quite likely that she
spiked one of his drinks with the lethal
dose of chloroform,
and the combination of that with his
previous
dental treatment explains
why he didn't have the conditions
coroners would have suspected, because they were looking for damage and
erosion to the GI tract. But if he was
already
self-administering chloroform as
an analgesic, you would expect some
level of that GI damage to have
been in place already. 

So more or less,
it is definitely possible that she
poisoned him
with a drink and then poured more drink,
or he swallowed more liquids, and
the traces in the esophagus and the
mouth that should have been there wasn't
there because he had swallowed
other liquids afterwards?

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I
think
the dilution effect of the wine
would have eased the conditions
of the corrosion and the damage
to the GI tract. 

So more or less,
the pimlico mystery isn't actually a
mystery anymore?


Well it's hypothetical. I wouldn't like
to criticize
the coroners at the time.
The coroners were were crown prosecution
coroners. \[does trumpet sounds]
Hold for applause...
\[Laughter] 

Excuse us listeners, we're pissed. It's the only way we can get over our
social anxiety.
\[Laughter] 

I'm so sweaty \[Laughter] 

But I think at the time there wasn't the science available
to determine the administration route
and that's what got Adelaide off.
Because also, the landlord found
a bottle and they found that it smelled
of brandy and some kind of
ether. Ether has a typically sweet smell,
so they wouldn't have immediately
identified it as chloroform.
But the fact that chloroform was readily
available as prescription
and that George Dyson had
suspicious circumstances in purchasing
the chloroform, leads towards the guilty
prosecution of Adelaide.
But obviously, without being able to
autopsy
and determine stomach contents
and body condition and things like that,
it will forever remain a mystery.


But also like, looking back on it now,
reverend Dyson said that: "oh, I didn't
realize
how suspicious this was
until after I did it" like
buying the bottles of small amounts of
chloroform from
four different shops and stuff like
that. And I'm like: "oh uh,
it smells like ether to me!". No, I mean
like,
it smells like pre-meditative murder to
me!

The laws at the time said that you only had to sign for and put a
record down
for volumes of chloroform that were
high volume. But if you had been
told by someone to buy
x amount of chloroform and you then
went about it... And went to all of these
different chemists
and suppliers and bought a volume
below the level that you needed to
supply
a reasoning and a signature, it
does become slightly suspicious. And then
you tie that into the fact
that Thomas had changed his will not long after meeting
the vicar... He was basically courting them.
He was allowing them to meet, he didn't
mind their relationship,
they could kiss in his presence while he
was smoking a pipe in
the corner of the room... 

But I don't think
he
did actually allow them to do that. I
think that was
like a rewrite of history from Adelaide
and George Dyson. Because it's like, well
they said that that was the case. 

Which
then begs even more questions
as to why he changed his will. 

I think
that they probably persuaded him
to take that like clause out
of the will, maybe when he was already
drugged.


Yeah. 

And after that, after the whole shebang, she was acquitted by the way
because they didn't have enough
evidence. 

She was also acquitted under a statement to say that there's
quite overwhelming evidence
to suggest that she had done it, they
just
couldn't prove how it had been
administered without
causing the damage that they would
expect
through oral administration.


Did you feel like you solved it? 

No,
I think it will always remain unsolved
until someone looks at 
how easy it is to administer liquid
chloroform
through some kind of diluent. 

It has to
be
possible, right? 

Anything's
possible. 

So follow your dreams.


Oh, I did have a question. Are you
gonna do a trailer
for every podcast, or was it just a
trailer
for us in general? 

It's a trailer for us
in general.


Okay. 

But I might change it if I have
something
better...

If I had
any shit to work with. \[Laughter]
That's fine, I was just curious. 

Curious and criouser. 

All right let's get on
with this shit.


Okay, should we say bye to the bots?


Sure, why not. 

Goodbye bots! Is
this because we talked about the russian
government last time, that we have so
many bot downloads?
So many. 

It's, it's quite possible.


Bye russian bots! 

Hello russia!
