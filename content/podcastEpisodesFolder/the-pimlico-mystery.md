The case discussed is the poisoning of Thomas Edwin Bartlett. Joe solves the case using his trusty companion, science, and Sandra speculates about how many food items one eats whole without chewing. 

Bonus content: 

* A very insistent vocal cameo by Bodil (the cat)
* Introduction of G.I Joes arch nemesis G.I Damage 
* A personalised message to the Russian bots (tirelessly scouring the InterNjet)

Not to mention, Joe solves the case (with a lil help from the British Medical Journal). Sandra got her information from murderpedia.org, Joe got his information from wikipedia (which is also where the photo of Adelaide comes from), as well as these two articles: 

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2542684/ 
* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27788591/
