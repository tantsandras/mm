#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

Speaking of tone of voice, Niklas... They had like a scheduled zoom break time at his work, and Niklas was eating birthday cake, and people were like

do you have cake like us he was like

yeah

i have cake every monday no reaction

someone was like is that a joke he was

like yes

obviously it's a joke i don't bake cakes

every monday

and they were like we can't tell with

you because you've never

changed your tone of voice

understandable

the thing is with both me and niklas is

that

people can't tell when we're being

sarcastic

you need to watch the harry potter

movies more

and just channel your inner snape is

obviously line is pretty obviously

riddled with snape

so what you're trying to say is that i

should always

end my sarcastic sentences with

obviously

yeah but maybe work on your snape

impression and

less of your bane impression

so

okay so it's wednesday which means that

it's time to talk about crime you were

listening to

midweek murders and i'm your host sandra

and i am your host sandra now

i was so proud of me getting through

that

and then you ruined it

and i'm your host joe this week we're

going to talk about the murder of

courtney valentine brown my sources were

an article in essex live news by hope

woolston an article on the crown

prosecution

service and an article on eye news

by depica roshani my source was

a three-part

documentary called murder 24

7 on the bbc

oh that's it that's it yeah sorry i mean

that was

three hours of my life and technically

six hours of my life because i watched

it twice

it's a camera crew that followed the

police throughout the entire course of

the investigation

so it's pretty much first person

evidence

of the whole thing so in this case i

don't think you can get

a better source than from the old

proverbial horse's meth you know

i'm shy courtney valentine brown

was a 36 year old man living in a rented

flat

on roots hall drive in

south and on sea the police were called

to his residence

following several reports of a

disturbance

on the 21st of february 2019

shortly before midnight when they got

there

they found a gruesome scene and an

unresponsive

courtney who was badly injured

the flat was in a state of disarray with

blood smears and splatters

all over the walls and toppled furniture

as well as a broken hob in the kitchen

the police and paramedics tried to tend

to his injuries

but courtney sadly passed away at 1

20 a.m so now i'm going to ask you about

the state

of oh god straight in there and that's

all i have

now i have more i just for once thought

about

asking you before getting to all of the

other stuff

so what was the state of courtney's body

so like you said there was blood found

all over the walls

all over the sofa they also found blood

on the washing machine in the kitchen

which was a separate room

paramedics were called to the scene they

performed emergency first aid and

courtney was taken to hospital as a

verbatim quote he was losing blood

as fast as they could replenish it so

he would have been having blood

transfusions to try and pump in as much

blood as possible to get him back to his

normal level but he was just bleeding

that out

straight away and unfortunately they

couldn't arrest the bleeding

in time to be able to save him so he

went into cardiac arrest

and passed away didn't they cut an

artery in the thigh the pathologist

found that the cause of death was a stab

wound

to the right thigh they noted

that the blade had passed all the way

through the front of the thigh and there

was an

exit wound at the back of the thigh

that's

one hell of a blade that's like a

machete

and it gets worse it gets worse oh no

oh no so there was a two and a half

centimeter entry wound at the front of

the thigh

they also found that there was a lot

of muscle damage inside of the thigh

and the exit wound was almost

180 degrees in comparison to the entry

wound

so what they determined from that is

that whilst

the suspect was plunging the knife

they were also twisting it oh no

oh that's so gruesome so they'd almost

turned the blade but it would have been

90 degrees rather than 180 i think that

was

a misquote from the police officers like

you said

they severed courtney's femoral artery

femoral artery that's the one that

supplies all of the blood flow

to your legs so from that evidence the

pathologist determined that the blade

was at least 17 centimeters long

they managed to determine that from the

depth of

courtney's thigh so it was at least

17 it could be longer they

thought that it probably was longer

because there were no

hilt mark bruising that you would expect

to see

from the handle of the blade so if you

stab someone quite aggressively

and cause that kind of rupturing to

major blood vessels

you would expect to see the bruising

from the handle

of the blade on the front of the thigh

but there was none of that evident at

all so it was

at least 17 centimeters but most likely

bigger than that they also found that he

had suffered

quite a severe head wound that was

attributed to

blunt force trauma they also found

significant defense wounds on courtney's

person

so both of his arms had

cut marks on them consistent with a

knife attack

and his right index finger

was almost severed that implied

to the investigating officers that he'd

grabbed the blade

he would have grabbed the knife blade

side

to try and defer any kind of attack

and it almost cut his finger off oh god

he was subject to quite a sustained and

brutal attack yeah so the police

interviewed courtney's neighbors and

they told the police that they had seen

courtney's landlord

31 year old kelly king entering

courtney's flat the same night

accompanied

by three men carrying knives and

a baseball bat one of the neighbors said

that

she had heard a lot of crashing after

kelly

and her gaggle of ruffians had entered

courtney's flat can we talk about the

old lady

so police officers did a door-to-door

knocking

to try and find out if any of the other

flat residents had heard any kind of

disturbance

so they visited the lady that lived

underneath

the flying question bless her she was a

just

turned 90 year old lady

she still had her birthday balloons and

they were like

have you just turned 90 and this lady

was like

what what

turned around she was like oh oh yes

i've just had

90. not sure how reliable you're gonna

be my dear

they asked her if she'd had any

disturbance from the night before

so she said this is a quote verbatim

it was like two japanese wrestlers

coming through the ceiling

the interview went back and forth and

then she clearly had no

idea what had happened she just heard

this banging yeah

and then she said

it was like someone was committing

murder up there

oh no \[ __ ] we should put you on the

investigation

team just wanted to put her out there

because i loved that old lady i thought

she was great

yeah there was one point where she was

considering hitting the ceiling with a

broom

keep the noise down my cats are trying

to sleep

okay so after getting this information

the police found

kelly king at the home of a man named

ian slater

who they suspected had been one of the

men who had

accompanied kelly based on eyewitness

testimony

kelly was then taken to the police

station

and interrogated but she withheld any

information and only answered the

questions

with no comment the police didn't have

a choice but to release her on bail

as they couldn't formally charge her of

the crime

due to lack of evidence fifty-year-old

ian slater

from lee on sea surrendered himself to

police

and he was arrested on suspicion of

murder on the 24th

of february three days after the crime

yeah why did he surrender himself

the theory and the documentary did put a

bit of

emphasis on this they were contacting

his known associates

and basically putting the pressure on

ian

to know that he was being looked for

by the police so he would have had no

doubt in his mind

that the police knew that he was

involved in some way

and they wanted to speak to him okay and

because

in his opinion he wasn't guilty of the

murder

because he didn't deal the final blow

that caused courtney to lose his life he

probably

thought that if he went into the station

gave this evidence that he was going to

give

and gave it willingly he wouldn't be

involved

with the prosecution is my thoughts

behind

why he turned himself in okay so ian

then

gave the police the name of his

accomplice

alex stevens he sound like a canary

police asked a question he gave him an

answer with

loads of detail he says that the

intention

was for them to go to kelly's flat where

courtney is staying

and throw him and his drug associates

out

and so ian in his interview said

that he needed someone to come with him

as backup so he was going to take the

pit bull

as he called him so the police officers

well

who do you mean by the pit bull and he

said alex

stevens they ran the name alex stevens

in the police database

and they got 16

pages of police records against alex

stevens

drug possession drug dealing possession

of dangerous weapons

gbh afraid what is gbh

grievous bodily harm oh my god why

isn't he in prison he has been in and

out

gbh generally doesn't get a very long

term depends on if the gbh is with a

dangerous weapon

which will get a longer sentence than

gbh just with

fisty cuts he had a massive rap sheet

and was also imprisoned previously

for i think manslaughter

why isn't he in prison it's probably

because he's so pretty

you see though i saw the photo i saw

the mug shots they don't do injustice

i'll be honest

okay you find him attract all right he's

a handsome guy

i will give him that during ian's

interview

he also said and quote it was supposed

to be

verbal it's not believable

because they did carry weapons going in

there

they did so after ian had given that

interview

there was a call to the general

101 non-emergency police line and a

couple of people had been reporting

that there were drug deals happening in

their local area

that they wanted the police to

investigate and they gave a location for

those drug deals

and when the police searched that

location they found

that one of the homes in that area was

registered

to a mr alex stevens

so they raided it so given that alex had

quite an extensive rap sheet they

obviously went in

all guns blazing kicked down the door

found alex trying to run away in the

back garden

immediately arrested alex so obviously

as known

drug dealer alex had multiple

phones eventually they seized

15 from his flat police officers

obviously searched the house

collected all of the evidence on a bed

and

one of the officers was like well

there's a white flip phone that's gone

missing

where's the white flip phone alex has

been taken away

at this point so it's just a girlfriend

in the flat they searched their bags and

she was like i haven't got anything on

me you've already searched me oh

\[ __ ] hell and they're like no we

haven't searched you we've searched your

bags

what's that in your pocket it looks like

a mobile phone she's like i haven't got

a mobile phone in my pocket it's my \[ __ ]

how there was a mobile phone in my

pocket sorry

and they were like that's not the white

flip phone where is it we're missing it

if it doesn't turn out we're gonna have

to do a strip search on you she was like

what on me i haven't got it it's not on

me there's

all of the pockets all of her bags all

of her possessions

and couldn't find this white phone that

the officer was adamant that he'd seen

so she was sitting down on the sofa just

as they were considering what to do

and then the phone started ringing

she was like i was in my pocket this

whole time it's not my fault you didn't

find it

which i just thought was hilarious i

really enjoyed that made me laugh out

loud

they do three interviews with

alex and as her

his legal advice he remains

completely silent they did get a

little bit of a breakthrough so alex

asks

if he can make a phone call i presume

he calls his brother but the call is

made by a speakerphone

so the officers can all hear and one of

the sentences that raises

officer suspicions is have you been

round

mums yet so then they obtained a warrant

to be able to search

alex's parents dress and they seized

a hoodie that showed dark spatters

which could possibly be blood but they

couldn't test it presumptively because

that would have destroyed the evidence

a pair of trainers which did test

positive for blood and a baseball bat

if you remember courtney suffered

a blunt force trauma to the head which

would have been conducive

with a baseball bat there we have it

so when alex was arrested they seized

a backpack and in ian slater's

interviews with the police he said

that alex had a rucksack

with him that he used to put the weapon

back into when they recovered that

rucksack they found

blood inside the bag and two

mobile phones with blood on them

when they looked at the cell mass data

they found that alex's

phone was pinging a cell mast

all day in one location a couple of

hundred meters away from his home

so they knew that he'd been there for

about 12 hours

the next activation they got was at 23

35 p.m which was at the mast

pointing towards the crime scene the way

that they know that it's

pointing towards somewhere is that that

phone

mast will show you at which direction it

send

data into and i feel it worth pointing

out that

the offense occurred at 23.53

so they already had some evidence to

show that alex had

been in the vicinity of the crime scene

but it wasn't yet enough to be able to

charge him they still didn't have the

murder weapon and they still didn't have

anything to link him

to being in that location so they went

back to

ian in one of ian's interviews ian said

that alex had brought along an associate

and ian only knew him as

fatty wow so we had

been brought along by kelly as muscle

ian had brought along alex as muscle

and alex had brought along fatty

as muscle oh yeah now at this point the

police

get a big old piece of juicy

luck so in the uk

there's a tv program called crime

stoppers

don't know if you're aware of it i've

never seen it but i know about

it it's essentially a tv program

that talks about serious crimes that

have occurred

and all of the evidence that's available

to the police

so this case would have been included on

the episode

they would have said anybody with any

information call the police

so a member of the public calls in

and identify his fatty as

a mr stuart pearson

so that coincided with the evidence that

they had already

that was that four people had entered

the flat ian

was positively identified kelly was

positively identified

ian identified alex and

the fourth person was identified by an

eyewitness

as stewart so they went to the house

that

stuart was registered as living act and

lo and behold stewart was there so they

arrested him on suspicion of

murder while

he was being interviewed he admitted

to meeting up with alex on the day of

the murder

but denied all involvement of the crime

said that he'd met him

at about 8 or 9 pm that alex

had taken his phone had

gone off to secure some cocaine

and then come back and given stuart his

phone back

police officers were like nah alex has

got 20 phones designed happening

you don't give someone your phone that's

just common sense

stuart pearson obviously knew that the

police were going to check

phone records and locations and things

like that so he tried to come up with a

reason

why he wouldn't be associated

but his phone records showed that

he was at home between 6 p.m

and 11 23 p.m

and then at 11 34 his

phone was activating the same

mast that alex's phone was activating

at the time of the crime so alex's phone

was activating at 11

35 and pearson's phone was activating

at 11 34. both phones

were active and pinging at the mast

by the crime scene pointing towards

the crime scene they then saw that

pretty much

immediately after the offense both

phones were activating the same

original masts so they'd both

gone from home crime scene and then back

to their respective homes

when they did a little more

investigation into pearson's house

they found a knife

so the knife that they found was

approximately 24

centimeters in length the wound was at

least

caused by a 17 centimeter blade

so it matches in that criteria

but they also found it in a pile of

burnt

debris they'd set a fire and chuck the

knife in it because they knew that was

the murder weapon

the knife was sent for profiling

and the officers were actually quite

optimistic they thought that

once they got past all of the city

carbon deposits they might still be able

to recover

some dna or some blood

unfortunately they couldn't however a

bit further

digging into the mobile numbers

of both kelly king and ian slater

they did find some ominous text messages

exchanged between the two so kelly

sends to ian the message final straw

had enough just kicked off they'd better

watch this \[ __ ] space

i ain't playing games either to which

ian replies no messing collect

any knives or nasties that you can

without them seeing now the police

officers

had two theories as to what

those messages could mean

the first theory this is the one that i

believe

so ian slater has given kelly the

instruction to remove

any knives or nasties as he put it i

assume any other kind of weapon

that courtney could use in his defense

when they go and attack him the second

theory

is that ian is instructing kelly to get

any knives that are currently in the

flat

for them to use as weapons and i find

that less believable because everybody's

got a kitchen knife

yeah and then a little bit further

digging into the text messages

and they can see that between kelly

ian stewart and alex

there are multiple messages that are

detailing

the attack so they've plotted it and

it's premeditated kind of thing

that's pretty much all i have other than

the sentencing okay

so years later alex stevens and stuart

pearson were

charged with the murder of courtney in

march and in april

police arrested kelly king as well

on the charge of murder so when the

trial

started the events were described as

such

kelly king claimed that she had wanted

to evict courtney

because of an argument about debt

she had then asked slater who was her

partner

to help her get courtney to move out

so they had then recruited stevenson

pearson to come with

and the four of them had gone to

courtney's flat

armed things had surprise surprise

turned violent it was definitely

premeditated attack but i think it's

ambiguous to say that the four of them

attended

armed when only two of them were armed

yeah the whole story about him

owning debt to kelly i'm like

did he though i just want to say that i

have a suspicion that they went there

because they knew

that courtney was a drug dealer

and wanted to rob him yeah given

alex's background he probably definitely

probably definitely has a great use of

english

there was probably ulterior motives

for alex getting involved and it

probably

wasn't solely down to the debt yeah

but i do think it's important to state

that it was

only alex and stewart that were armed

okay

alex was reported as making his money

from robbing drug dealers yeah i

had no idea about that because i just

read the articles

which were very vague yeah they were

incredibly vague

the first thing that came into my mind

was

that this was not get rid of the

competition

yeah okay so on the 29th

of january 2020 ian slater and alex

stevens was sentenced

to 26 years in prison for

murder while stuart pearson and

kelly king received the total sentence

of

nine years for manslaughter

alex stevens was charged with the murder

for dealing the fatal blow ian

slater was charged with murder

because he recruited

alex okay according to bbc news

detective chief inspector daniel

stoughton

said of the criminals for four people to

go

to an address where the victim was going

to leave

anyway and take weapons and assault him

is absolute cowardice and

tragically courtney lost his life

courtney's family stated that we are

heartbroken

over the murder of our dear son brother

uncle and cousin who was tragically

taken away from us prematurely he was

ambitious

cheeky and extremely creative with this

whole future ahead of him

despite his life challenges

yeah so that's the case thank you so

much for listening

to midweek murders we'll see you next

week

bye bye

ciao
