#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

I mean it's definitely worth it, because Harry Potter world is amazing. It's so immersive. Every so often in the day, they pick someone in the audience to do the scene where Harry finds his wand, and their hair gets blown up, and the lights flicker and all of that. So me and my sister went to the one shop twice in a day, and were both standing around like: "Yes, I would like to be chosen! Yes, I'm here, please pick me! Pick me!".

Didn't you get pulled on stage for something? 

Yes I did.

What was it? 

So again, throughout the course of the day they'll do like live performances. So in one section it was some people doing a Durmstrang dance, and then there was like a puppet show type thing that told the tale of three brothers... 

Oh, cool.

And then a Celestina Warbeck impersonator sang some songs... 

This is the one, isn't it?

Yeah. And for one of her songs she needed a volunteer from the audience. And she was on before the three brothers puppet show, so me and my sister had picked front row seats for the puppet show, and then she came on and she was like: "You! Come and dance with me." \[Laughter]

That's such a bad decision. Not that I doubt your performance aptitude, I just mean that you must have been the one person in that crowd that 100% did not want to do that. \[Laughter]

Considering the crowd would have been mainly Americans, who love getting up on stage and making a fool of themselves, and she was like: "I'm gonna pick the one neurotically self-conscious Brit that is sitting in this audience, and make him feel well and truly humiliated". So obviously, I let all of my inhibition go, gave a wonderful performance, and all the Americans loved it.

What did you actually do, though? 

I've repressed it. All I remember is at one time I was in a line of four, I think, backup dancers and I had a feather boa around my neck doing the can-can. \[Laughter]

I would pay money to see this. 

I mean, obviously my little sister filmed it, but I have never asked for a copy of it.

The mental image of you being... 

I mean the mental image of me being draped in a feather boa, not that unusual. The mental image of me dancing, yes, not very common. 

The mental image of you being the least willing participant in that crowd, it's just sending me. I don't know, it's so funny. 

She must have looked into my eyes and thought: "That's a guy that doesn't want to participate".

And she just realized all of your worst nightmares.

Actually, when I got up on stage and we obviously made introductions, she asked me my name and then I had to do a dance with her. And she, just before we started, whispered in my ears: "Let me lead". \[Laughter]

\[Music]

It's wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra! Sandra.

Sandra! 

Sandra!

She's your host Sandra, and I'm your host Joe!

That's Joe, yeah. 

This week...

That's what I said.

Yeah, this week....

\[Sighs]

Are you quite finished? 

No, no. Please carry on, you're doing great. What's happening this week? 

This week we're going to talk about the murder of Helle Crafts. I got my information from wikipedia, Forensic Files season 1 episode 1! Crazy! So long ago. And forensic files now, a blog, and murderpedia.org.

I got mine from criminally intrigued, morbidology, and forensic training unlimited. And wiki wiki wah, obviously. 

So Helle Nielsen was a 39 year old danish flight attendant living in connecticut with her husband, Richard Crafts. She grew up in Denmark, but attended college in England, and worked as an au pair in France for a while. So she spoke French, English, Danish obviously, and understood other languages, such as German, Swedish, Norwegian. Although, we're all close to each other, but you know. So she was quite bright. She was described as a very warm person, and was well liked by all who came across her. Which, I feel like, I do believe that. But also, it is how everyone is described after they die. 

I wouldn't be described that way. 

No, you wouldn't. \[Laughter]

No, you're great. You're great at socially fronting.

The couple had three children, and Helle met her husband in Miami in 1969 when she was training to be a flight attendant for Pan Am, and Richard was training to be a pilot. Helle had been one of eight people chosen by Pan Am to begin training, out of 200 applicants. And I don't know how well-versed you are in like airline history, I'm not. But I'm just gonna say that it was a very highly sought after job, because it was very prestigious. After Helle had been taking care of their children for a couple of years, she returned to her work. And the couple's combined income put them in the top five percent of wage earners in America, in the 1980s. Which is crazy. Isn't that crazy?

Well, he was a pilot, wasn't he? Pilots have always been well paid.

Yeah. Especially because I think they're still quite well paid, and nowadays they don't actually have to do a lot.

No, other than take off and land. That's pretty much it.

Yeah. That's quite a cushy job, it's quite nice. Maybe I should be a pilot.

It's a lot of training. 

Yeah. Like years?

Yeah, and I don't think you've got the eyesight for it, unfortunately.

Probably not. Did you know that a lot of people... You probably know this. A lot of people, on their spare time, do flights but as a computer game. So they do exactly what they do in flights, and then they just sit out the hours when they fly, and then they land. And that's what people do for a hobby. I'm like: "You're not in an actual airplane". I don't understand. But probably nice to know, if you're ever in a statistically implausible situation. 

"Do we have any pilots on board?!" 

"Oh, I've done some simulatory time." 

"Perfect!" \[Laughter]

You know all about this. I just find it incredibly weird. But also, to each their own. I mean, everybody needs a hobby. I'm trying to be so nice, I don't... "Nize". I put a snus in my mouth, I was like: "I'm trying to be so nize".

"Trying to be nize".

I just feel like, I'm not actually like this. I'm presenting myself in a false narrative. Oh well. Richard... \[Laughter] Richard controlled... 

"This isn't me! Fuck all you people and your shitty flight simulator hobbies!"

"Actually, I don't understand it, okay?!"

"You fucking nerds! Get a real job." \[Laughter]

Richard controlled all of their money, and spent a lot of it on his hobby, which was collecting guns. And other useless shit. 

Wow. Well, I know what the description of this episode's gonna be: "Sandra shits on people's hobbies". \[Laughter]

Yeah. 

You like collecting stuff? Well that's a stupid thing to do.

But also, he forced Helle to pay for all of their stuff that they needed, such as gas and like food and stuff, that is important. And then he took control of all other money that was coming in, and spent it on shit. And also, he went away a lot and like slept with other women. Paid them money, bought them shit, bought himself shit. He didn't put one dime into that family. So I was like: "Fuck this Richard". Or maybe we should call him the dick. Because... \[Laughter] Because Richard is... \[Laughter] Oh god. This is also funny: and, in Connecticut, Richard was working part-time as a volunteer police officer. He often spent his free time at the police station, and he would respond to 911 calls without authorization. He also bought a car that was the same make as the police cars. There was a note about what kind of make it was, but I was like: "I don't know". 

"Hurr durr, cars, durr".

Cars, all the same to me. And spent his own money, and then I put in parentheses: "and Helles", on fitting the car with radios and sirens. So that it would look like a police car, but it wasn't actually a police car. This weirdo was described by people who worked with him as: "nice but introverted". And then I put in all caps: "Quiet people aren't automatically nice!". That's a life lesson... 

That I do not subscribe to.

Do you not? Of course you do. 

No. Quiet people are always nice.

No. You're just trying to wind me up. I won't be wound up. Is that a real word, wound? 

Yeah. 

Yeah! I was like: "It is!" 

"I did it! I Englished!"

I did the English. Helle's friends had noticed bruising on her face several times, and she had told her friends that: "If something happens to me, don't think that it was an accident". She had been aware of Richard's affairs with other women for a while, but decided to hire a private investigator in 1986, to obtain proof of this. This wasn't actually said in any of the articles, but I'm guessing it was because of the divorce. 

oh it makes sense yeah

yeah i think so because people said like

oh she recently discovered

but then other sources said she knew

because he was away for most of the year

just out and about doing his other stuff

and she knew that this was a thing i

mean it's probably a bad idea

to use as an excuse that you're out

flying

with someone who also works in the

aviation industry

because you know they're gonna know all

the rules and regulations about how

often you're allowed to fly

yeah i think so because he was

definitely not out flying he

did go to like gun conventions and stuff

like that but i think he also

went away on trips and \[ __ ] and she kind

of knew that so

the private investigator she hired was a

guy named

keith mayo a former connecticut

coleslaw no i'm just kidding

a former connecticut police officer who

managed to catch

richard in the act of kissing another

woman on camera

hella also met with a divorce attorney

and told her friends and family about

this

so they all knew like her colleagues on

the airplane and her friends

and her mother knew that she was filing

for a divorce

she also told her divorce attorney

who was interviewed in the forensic

files episode

about like if i disappear

richard had something to do with it she

was also

scared of him because he was a pilot for

mission for the cia and he had told her

that he could track her

everywhere so she was afraid of him

at this point probably way before that

as well

on the 18th of november 1986

helen had been working on a flight from

germany

and her friend dropped her off at the

craft's home

a terrible snowstorm hit connecticut

during that night

and in the morning richard took his

children

to his sister's house but hello was not

with them

when people wanted to get in contact

with her richard gave a

multitude of stories about where Helle

was

such as she was visiting her mother in

denmark

before she was on the canary islands

with a friend

to some inquests he simply answered that

he didn't know where she was

when hella failed to show up for work on

the 1st

of december and hadn't called in sick

her colleagues reported her missing

keith mayo the pi

had tried to get the local police to

look into hela's disappearance

but they refused to as a side note

this is where he worked as a part-time

wannabe police officer

so i thought he worked part-time as a

waitress in a cocktail bar

so he really tried to be like no

she's disappeared and they did nothing

and then he got like her friends or

maybe her friends did it on their own

volition but they

called in like several times to the

police and they were like

did nothing so after a while the county

prosecutor referred the case to the

state police probably because the local

police

as i said did nothing mayo also

interviewed the crafts au pair

dawn marie thomas who told him that she

had been woken up at six in the morning

after helen was last seen richard had

informed her that hele had left

to go to his sister and that he was

taking the children there

immediately the old parrot found this

strange

as driving in a snowstorm would be

stupid

but richard put everyone in the car and

drove them to his sister's house

but hella wasn't there even though

richard had said that helen left

earlier as i said when richard came to

pick them up at 7pm

she still hadn't seen Helle

dawn had asked richard where hela was

and at first he had just answered i

don't know

she also told mayo that there had been a

dark spot on the carpet

in the couple's bedroom but shortly

after

she saw this dark spot pieces of the

carpet

were missing and when she asked richard

about this

he said that he had spilled kerosene on

it

i had to google what kerosene was it's

an oil

it's like a crude form of petrol or

gas okay but i'd like to interject at

this point

although he may have been working with

the cia

and police and air force and private

pilot and blah blah

he obviously wasn't a particularly

intelligent man

you've got a suspicious stain on your

carpet

so the first thing that you come up with

is to blame it

on a liquid that is one

clear and two does not

leave stains oh i didn't know

kerosene will not leave a stain it will

stink

and you'll be able to smell it because

it's like going to a petrol station and

pouring petrol on the floor

but it will not stain maybe he thought

that

she didn't see the stain i don't mean

it's even more questionable given the

in that house they had kerosene fueled

heaters

oh so everyone should be familiar in

that household

with kerosene yeah and it was like oh

it's not blood it's kerosene

that is \[ __ ] stupid i think that

this man had a severe case of narcissism

of course he did

it's the go-to diagnosis but it is

because

it's quite common isn't it i mean given

how many narcissists we've come across

doing this podcast i would say yes yeah

so keith mayo suspected there might be

blood on the missing pieces of carpet

and he took things into his own hands oh

that's going to introduce some

contradictory evidence i hope he wore

gloves

that was a forensics joke you're welcome

i didn't get it at first but then i was

like that was funny

it's for the support

he took things into his own hands and

recruited a couple of friends

or colleagues or something of that sort

i don't know

actually to help him search the

canterbury

dump where he figured out that the

craft's

trash was ending up for the missing

pieces of carpet

and this is quite funny because i read

this whole thing about

what he did to figure that out like he

rode with a trash truck

driver and i was like yeah a for effort

i mean he could have just emailed the

council

this is in the 80s so okay could have

gone to the library then

it could affect them he probably could

have done actually

like what's the landfill for this route

and they would have been like blah blah

blah he could have probably

called them oh no one does that

especially not you emails for the win

so they eventually found some pieces of

carpet that looked

very similar or almost the exact same

to the carpet in the crafts bedroom and

sent these away for testing let's just

say i take

umbrage to the phrase almost the exact

same

yeah no i know i think that was actually

a quote from one of my sources

i'm gonna guess they said that it kind

of looks like it

close enough to warren sending off yeah

they had probably

searched for hours and they were like oh

a piece of carpet

must be that'll do he tried

more than the popo did yeah i'm not

trying to

piss on his parade but i'm like might

not have been

the same carpet because of mayo's

investigating though

they managed to get hella's

disappearance noticed by the press

so almost a month after hella had been

reported missing

richard was away with the children and

the police searched the crafts home

they found a blood smear on the side of

the bed

and this might have been on a comforter

or not i'm not sure i only found there

was on the side of the bed

okay and a large freezer was missing

from the garage

after dinging through richard's credit

card records

they noticed that richard had rented a

commercial

wood chipper in the days around when

helle had disappeared i couldn't

find an exact date on that but it was

during the disappearance

there was also a receipt for a chainsaw

and this will become pertinent soon

as the press started covering the case a

snow

plow driver named joe hein

contacted the police as he had seen a

man

driving a truck with a wood chipper

strapped

to it only hours after hella was last

seen

he told police that he had seen the

truck park close to the shoreline

and left them to that area this is a bit

confusing and you can correct me on this

but

as i read gladly

as i read it at this location the police

found the crown of a tooth

a letter addressed to hele a fingernail

covered in red nail polish and i think

that might have been a bit of a finger

as well

with a fingernail on it bone chips

2 and

bleached blonde human hairs and

o type blood the same type as helles

in the water they retrieved parts of a

chainsaw

which was where some of the hairs came

from

as i understand it and the chainsaw

parts that they retrieved also had a

scratched off serial number

so what was the bit that you're confused

about just of the evidence they found

because i found a bit of a

differentiating

report on that yeah so you pretty much

covered it they found

small pieces of metal which they think

could have come from her wedding ring

and a total of 85 grams

of human tissue including the crown of

tooth the fingernail bone chips

and the blood the crown in the tooth was

matched to heller according to dental

records

the human hairs did you read anything

about that

only that they matched it oh no they

couldn't match it

obviously because there was no body yeah

but they matched

it microscopically to hair that they

found

in her hair brush but i'm like how

closely can you match hairs

microscopically

it's surprising how much detail you can

get from hairs and fibers

microscopically so if they had a

reference of her hair

from a hairbrush they would have been

able to almost conclusively be able to

match it

to that of what came off it helps that

she dyed her hair because obviously

when your roots start coming through

yeah will be a different point for

different people depending on

the rate of their hair growth and when

they had their hair bleached or dyed or

whatever

so if they can determine at what stage

of the hair

it was bleached and compare that between

reference

and sample then you can pretty much

conclusively match

also the condition of the hair oh cool

you can get quite a lot of detail from a

microscope examination of hair

okay and a lot of fiber analysis

is just done with a microscope visually

so they'll look at what type of fiber it

is

and whether it's a match to any known

source

so i don't find it hard to believe they

matched it okay

little known factory listeners i don't

know if this is little known but

almost all adults in scandinavia

all blond adults are dyed blonde we're

not

actually blonde we're like a mousy brown

blonde

the blonds of us except in the summer or

if we move

to a more sunny country welcome to the

uk \[ __ ]

but this is very common for almost all

blonde adults

in scandinavia but i was going to say

that

speaking of fiber analysis i think they

also

found a lot of blue fiber which they

said

was probably from hella's favorite

night shirt or nightgown i'm not sure

yeah the source of that everything i

read conflicted

it was either underwear nightwear

clothing so i couldn't find anything

conclusive but there was definitely

scraps of fiber that they found yeah

yeah

it could have been a bedsheet did you

see it yeah he had

receipts for a sheet a comforter

i think we call that a duvet in the uk

as well as the chainsaw and the rental

of the

wood chipper and in terms of the nail

polish

it becomes significant because they also

seized

hailer's nail polish in the house so

then they would have been able to again

do a cross

reference of the source material

compared to

the evidence that they found without

going into

too much scientific detail because

they're very complicated techniques

they could have used a technique called

ftir

which is fourier transform infrared

spectroscopy

try saying that when you've had four

bottles of wine

which basically looks at how much light

is absorbed

in your sample material at multiple

different wavelengths

and obviously that will be very specific

to the structure and the topography

and the color of in this case

nail polish but you can use it for paint

it's very commonly used in paint

analysis for things like road traffic

accidents so if you find a paint chip

recovered

on the scene you can match it to the

make and model of

car that it came from really yeah

i'm not sure when ftir came

in and whether this case was too early

for it or whether they had to do the

so the ft the fourier transform is a

very very long calculation that nowadays

is done by a computer but they used to

have to do it

manually and good lord i feel sorry for

them people because i had to do it at

university and

jesus christ

it's not fun so

they could have done it through

microscopy and looked

at the topography so basically the

surface pattern

that the nail polish would have given

which would then

they'd be able to match because certain

nail polishes use different amounts

of primers and things to

basically make it from a liquid in the

bottle to dry

into a solid on your nail oh cool

i didn't know that well i should have

known but i

didn't realize it was that specific

i mean ftir now will be able to give you

a 100 match on

a known sample versus a seized sample

so if they were to look at it now and

found

that fingernail and the source nail

polish they would be able to say

definitively yes this is exactly the

same nail polish

from the bottle that is on the finger

yeah i

did find some things about the

chainsaw as i said the serial number was

scratched off

and they said that they could

conclusively link it

to uh what was it maybe an insurance

thing that richard the dick

clarks had sent in for that particular

chainsaw so

firstly my question to you dick crafts

why would you bother insuring a chainsaw

that you're just gonna chop up your wife

with and then dump it in a lake

yeah that's weird again we'll hark back

to the point of him

maybe not having so many street smarts

second of all

they actually got one of the leading

forensic scientists in the country to

investigate this case

yeah and i think he managed to partially

recover

the serial number yeah which they linked

back to the insurance document

wait henry lee yes dr henry lee

i think that he did a lot of work

during this case because some people

would have just thrown it out because

they couldn't find the body

yes so this was the first case that was

ever convicted

for murder without a body being present

so

i think a lot of etiquette i think yes

yeah yeah yeah

so i think a lot of either forensic

examiners

or prosecutors if it got to trial

wouldn't have put in the amount of

effort that dr lee did

in trying to make a conviction because

there was so little evidence to go with

and

that was actually a basis of dick's

appeal

so he appealed to the supreme court in

that

he was convicted on circumstantial

evidence which

he was because there's no body to match

it to

it's circumstantial evidence because

they couldn't link it to heller

yeah although i would say and this is

factually incorrect but i would say that

the letter

that they found addressed the heller and

his credit card records

buying a wood chipper and then her hair

being in the wood chipper i would say

that that's

more than circumstantial i get that it's

not

factually and that's exactly why

he was prosecuted and sentenced because

the amount of circumstantial evidence

and the category of it so the amount of

human tissue that they found the fact

that he had corroborating evidence of

hiring a wood chipper and buying a

chainsaw

and a freezer chainsaw as well

yeah it was enough evidence to be able

to prosecute him on

but still in a legal sense was

circumstantial

yeah i i get it but i just found it a

bit crazy

yeah it's a good thing that they were

willing to accept it

and prosecute him on it apart from one

juror the little \[ __ ] bag

yeah we'll get to it now the one juror

so

richard was sentenced to 50 years in

prison

on his second trial in 1989

as the first ended with hung jury and

that's

the thing i think one of the jurors

walked out

and refused to go back in or something

like that yeah so i think

on the 12th day of deliberation

or something crazy like that the one

juror

couldn't convince anybody else on the

jury and wouldn't change his mind

yeah so it had to be labeled as a

mistrial

and be retried with a new jury which is

a bit crazy because i think i read in

one of my sources

that this juror was a hundred percent

convinced that he was

innocent because helen was a polyglot

and could have just disappeared he was

like i don't think helle

kraft is dead we're assuming this

is a he no it is a it is a yeah

he was like i prayed to god i'm

convinced that he's

innocent i'm like that is not proof

that is an opinion it is not

evidence that's crazy to me

the entire jury for that first trial was

so

methodically searched for because of the

media attention that the case got

anybody who was familiar with the case

wasn't allowed to sit on the jury

so they went through rounds and rounds

and

hours and hours of interviewing jurors

to be able to find people to sit on the

jury

and then this guy was one of the people

that was

lucky enough to get chosen and he's a

god

bothering idiot who was like no i prayed

to the lord

and the lord told me that because she

speaks multiple languages she could have

just flown off anywhere

as is befitting of her career yeah it's

crazy no

there's bits of her that was found by a

lake you \[ \_\_ ] \[ \_\_ ]

yeah and that to me even though it's not

conclusive

i would say that it's beyond reasonable

doubt

i would have convicted him yeah and also

his

sister did no she tried against him

didn't she

yeah i think did support him getting

a life sentence because she was like nah

i think he did it and also

i think she said that his son was afraid

of him

i read that to you yeah if his own

sister is like no this guy is guilty

and then that one random juror is like

no

no i just don't believe it i'm like \[ __ ]

you \[ __ ] you

if i ever get picked for jury duty then

i know the person's guilty

i think that you and i are never going

to be able to

say in a jury because we're disqualified

for

having this podcast i think

i thought you were anonymous so i don't

know i don't want to get paid for doing

nothing

did i tell you about the time that my

old flatmate had to do jury duty

no yeah he got called up for jury duty

and after three days i think the case

got thrown out

and the case was police officer

a accuses police officer

b of stealing his

flashlight

this was a case that went to trial

in front of a jury

and you know why it got thrown out no

police officer a could not prove

that the flashlight found in police

officer b's possession

was police officer a's because they're

standard

issue flashlights

i'm sorry but that sounds what the \[ __ ]

a

dream society kind of kiss

like when you first said something about

this story i was like oh my god it's

going to be so bad oh my god

he did something the other police

officer did something really bad and

then they're trying to cover it up

and it's a \[ __ ] flashlight

standard issue they're all identical

he had no way to prove that it was his

torch just ask

for another one \[ __ ] hell

what a waste of taxpayer money

if that was the thing that police

officers

went to trial for that would be a dream

a utopia

that's funny kind of gives me hope about

the british police force even though i i

know that hope is misplaced

it felt like oh my god that's so nice

if that's the kind of story that

reinforces your faith in the uk judicial

system

where the \[ __ ] was your faith before

that story

in the gutter yeah

yeah and now it's risen so high that

it's just

perching on the curb just above the

gutter

waiting for the next rainfall to push it

back in

with one finger clutching

on the edge of the clinging on for dear

life

so what i also wrote down

was that richard kraft

has been released yes yep

which is crazy that gun collecting

wannabe police officer but no a police

officer

wife murdering son of a \[ __ ]

is out how in the \[ __ ] is that possible

because he was sentenced to 50 years and

he was a good boy in prison

yeah what are you gonna do now you gotta

sleep

probably i'm also gonna sleep

i also watched sister act one

recently because there's gonna be a

third one

and i've remembered that i found sister

egg one

funny watched it it was quite funny and

now i might see

the second one again because i have no

life and i'm still on lockdown even

though lockdown

apparently stopped the 3rd of december

and i didn't know yeah that's the thing

that happened

i saw this very uplifting clip of an

old man british man who were interviewed

by the

american media because he had done his

vaccine

and he was just delightful very british

but on american media was it

yeah he was interviewed by someone from

america i don't know yeah

which one but they interviewed him

because he had apparently called

i think some hospital that he lived

close to

and been like i want to do the vaccine

and they were like sure

come in and we'll do ya because he was

very old

and now he's gonna go meet his family

for christmas

but he was also so british about it he

was like i had a \[ __ ] day

i parked somewhere went to a restaurant

blah blah blah

oh was he the one that was complaining

about the parking at the hospital

yeah i think so

it was so funny as well because of the

american journalists

and the american journalist was

searching for like a feel-good

story and this man was like oh i had a

\[ __ ] day

it was raining couldn't park anywhere

they stabbed me with a bloody needle

youths on the corner blaring their pip

pop or whatever they call it

no he was delightful so maybe we should

hang up

maybe we should get out of here yeah
