Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

It's happening. 

Are you ready? 

No, I'm peeing.

It's happening. \[Laughter]

\[Music]



Hit me with your rhythm dick. That means I'm ready.

Yes, yes. I understand English. I watched a zombie series that might not be a zombie series, might still be about a pandemic. But one guy got stabbed, and I think I've asked you this before, but then they have to stitch him up and they do that by soaking a needle and a thread in 120% vodka. 

120%?

Yeah, that's too much isn't it? \[Laughter] I think that might just have been the name of the vodka.

Don't need to tell you with your classical language education that percent is latin for out of a hundred.

Maybe it's just a knock off of Absolute, like 120%. \[Laughter] Oh well. And I feel like, is that alcohol content in a vodka enough to sterilize a needle and a thread? 

Yes.

Yeah. It's wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra. 

And I'm your enthusiastic co-host Joe. 

Today we're gonna do a Halloween special, which means that we're gonna dwelve into some cases that has been unsolved, unresolved or paranormal. We're also going to do that next week, because next week is also before Halloween.

Because October bitches!

This week we're going to talk about the case of Gloria Ramirez. I got my information from wiki wikipedia, journal.medizzy.com

by journal yeah what the

journal journal

journal.medici.com

by dr amon shabab

straight dope.com

sorry by cecil

adams and an article in the washington

post

by christine spoeller

i got mine from an article in discover

magazine

a website called skeptoid

and an la times article

that i forgot to write down so i'll have

to fish that out afterwards but the

full sources will be available on our

website

so gloria ramirez a 30 year old woman in

california

was taking into the emergency department

of riverside general hospital by

paramedics

as she was suffering from both irregular

heart rhythm and irregular breathing

she also had lit staged cervicals

cancer but had not started chemo

treatment yet

at the hospital the medical staff

injected her with

oh god diazepam

meda

almost got it in an effort to sedate her

which i felt like was a bit of an

overkill do they usually

inject you with three different

sedatives

i don't know i'm not a doctor

fair enough i think she had a cocktail

because of

i don't think she was particularly

responsive to

any of the treatments that they tried so

they had to

sort of combine it but benzodiazepines

which all of those three drugs are

are quite common for tachycardia and

irregular breathing patterns

okay because they make you sleepy sleepy

gloria didn't seem to be responding to

treatment however

which led them to defibrillating

her which is the hard thing

right charging clear yeah

yeah at which point the nurses noticed

an oily sheen covering her body

as well as a fruity garlic smell which

i can't think of anything worse a fruity

garlic smell

it's like crumbling some garlic over

here

custard tart as well as the fruity

garlic

smell which they guessed emanated from

gloria's mouth

a nurse susan kane withdrew

blood from gloria and noticed an ammonia

smell

coming from the tube she assumed the

smell

might come from chemo treatment

that's what i read somewhere which might

not be true

i think because chemotherapy is

a technique that targets everything

in the body rather than radiotherapy

which is

targeted specifically at the tumor you

get cellular death

throughout the whole body so i think

it's probably quite common

for specific chemotherapies to cause

breakdown

of cells in the human body which would

lead to

ammonium products being in the blood

which is where they

attributed the smell to come from okay

and this

is noteworthy because she hadn't

started her chemotherapy yet even though

she had

as it said late staged cervical cancer

but they might have just caught it lit

so

she passed a syringe of the blood

to julie gorsinsky a medical resident

who then saw what appeared to be manila

colored particles

in the blood kane promptly passed out

and had to be removed from the room

gorsinsky then began to feel

nauseous and left the trauma room to sit

down

outside after which he also proceeded to

pass out

a respiratory therapist in the trauma

room

became the third person to pass out

after which a small group of medical

staff were left

trying to save gloria's life while the

rest of the hospital

were evacuated because they thought that

something

poisonous was happening the rest of the

emergency room not the entire hospital

oh yeah that makes sense sorry 45

minutes

after gloria had arrived at the er she

was pronounced dead

due to kidney failure which they

correlated to her

cancer so out of the 37

medical staff members who had been in

contact with gloria

23 of them had fallen ill wasn't it

37 that were working in the er it must

have been right

otherwise yeah i think that's a lot of

people to tend to one patient

yeah that's true although it might have

been just

people who were in contact with her so

like people

taking her from the paramedics to the

operating room people

in the operating room she didn't go to

an operating room

well the trauma room sorry the

paramedics take them there

oh yeah that doesn't make sense

so i'm not sure so now

i have several different theories

as to what may have happened

around gloria ramirez do you have

anything you want to say

now or should we dwelve into the

theories

or forever hold your piece you could

talk about

the first investigation that decided it

was mass hysteria oh yeah or is that one

of your theories

it's one of my theories so i can okay

then yeah plow straight on

okay so california's health

department put two scientists dr

anna maria osorio and kristen

waller in charge of trying to figure out

what happened

these scientists theorized that the

staff at the er

had suddenly become victims of

mass hysteria as their symptoms

didn't match and because their blood

tests

afterwards had been normal the main

point

that they found what they reasoned for

it to be

an outbreak of mass hysteria is that

the paramedics who initially treated

gloria

had no symptoms at all didn't come down

with

anything they were completely unaffected

they also said

that the majority of the people that

came down with

symptoms were women and historically

women are more subjected

to falling under mass hysteria which i

chortled at

a little bit

yeah i think it was a journal article

in a psychology journal in 2002

so it was peer-reviewed and properly

evaluated

that said that women are more likely to

be susceptible to bouts of mass hysteria

okay i also read that

more women than men that had been

around the area of gloria ramirez

did come down with symptoms but i don't

really

get it because i don't think hardened

nurses would just come down with like oh

i

fainted in a trauma room they're in

trauma rooms

for the majority of their

working lives well that's what the lady

who spent

the time in the icu said and she

actually sued the hospital

for the diagnosis of mass hysteria

saying

exactly that their a hardened medical

professionals

yeah they're not gonna swoon and feign

at the sight of blood or a funky smell

like how many drunks go to the er and

vomit

on a medical professional yeah people

are saying

labor they shit themselves all the time

like

i worked as a elderly

home carer i guess is the word

or something like that and the smells

that i came across

still lingers in my mind emergency rooms

can get anything they could have

patients with gangrene they could have

burns victims

they could like there's no way that

these medical professionals would have

fallen

to mass hysteria because of a bit of

an oily sheen and an ammonium spell

it doesn't make sense to me but what

also doesn't make sense

or what doesn't lend to this theory is

that

gorsinsky had spent two weeks afterwards

in

intensive care with liver inflammation

as well as bone tissue death

problems i don't think necrosis

and hepatitis are conditions

that are typically psychosomatic no

and also it can't just

happen both at once as

like an accident well statistically i'm

guessing

it can but i i'm leaning towards that

it might not be a sound theory because

of that

because i feel like that's too much of a

coincidence to happen

right after treating now

i will safely say that i think the mass

hysteria diagnosis is absolute nonsense

yeah i felt like that was improbable

yeah

they also found in that investigation

people who had shown the most severe

symptoms

had all worked within two feet of gloria

or handled

her intravenous lines

and venus you could just call it iv

okay which also

kind of lends to the fact that it wasn't

mass hysteria but that's what they found

so theory number two is

the hospital had a history of hazardous

gas leaks well gas leaks they say

but it might have been a sewage problem

because in april

1993 california occupational

safety and health administration

notified

the hospital that the first floor

emergency room was

flooded with sewer gas from a drain

a citation was issued even before that

in 1991

when two employees sought medical

treatment

after a possible leak of hazardous gas

from a sterilizer which i'm not entirely

sure what it is

a machine that's used to sterilize

surgical equipment

so that was in that context

but i'm not sure it has anything to do

with that okay

so in 1992

in 1992 the hospital was notified that

an inspection

had found algae growing in a water

resort reservoir and the doctor treating

gloria had noticed some weird fluid in a

sink

and then when the staff started fainting

he flushed that fluid down the drain

because he was

afraid that it might have something to

do with it

i'm not sure how much that

theory has anything to do with it but

another patient at the hospital before

that

had said that he was evacuated from his

room

like a couple of times because they said

that there was something wrong with

like the sewage did you read anything

about this

nope no okay it's a microwave maybe

a thing i don't know i don't

think either sewage gases

or algae cause the same range

of symptoms i know sewage gas can cause

nausea and dizziness and things like

that the same as

breathing in any gas because it

displaces the oxygen but

if it were to be sewage gas it would

have affected everyone

yeah all of the medical staff all of the

other patients

if it were the algae then it would have

affected anyone who would have used that

sink

and if it's a sink in an emergency

department it's probably going to be

used by all of the medical staff

so again why is it only affecting some

of them and

not others yeah that's true the third

theory is that gloria ramirez

takes painkillers which are

shortened as dmso

you know what that is dimethyl sulfoxide

oh which was readily available

at the time i think but then they took

it away from the market because they

were worried that it might

cause eyesight problems yes it was

originally issued as a medication

as a topical analgesic so a painkiller

that you apply

to your skin rather than ingest

more like a gel oh yeah after a clinical

trial

showed that it was affecting people's

eyesight the

fda the food and drugs administration in

america

took it off of the medical market but

it can still be bought from hardware

stores

and this is slightly concerning why

people would buy their

medication from a hardware shop it's an

excellent

degreaser so people working

in mechanics that get covered in grease

doing oil changes and things like that

rub a bit of dimethyl sulfoxide on you

gets rid of it

lovely job so it can still be bought

from hardware shops for that purpose but

it's not advised to be used

medically anymore but was that the case

at the time

yes so it was basically a home

remedy that she was using it for okay

but

like the likelihood of her knowing about

it as a home remedy

would you say that it was probable i see

no reason to believe that it wouldn't be

given that it was established as a

medical treatment

previously and we're not talking like 50

years

previously but maybe a couple and people

can get

very creative when it comes to home

remedies

for terminal or yeah

chronic cases of pain yeah okay

so before she died due to a

urinary blockage the dmso

builds up in her bloodstream and then

oxygen administered by the paramedics

converts the dmso in her blood

to dmso2

i'm not sure what that is but dnso

isn't its chemical name it's basically

an abbreviation

so dm dimethyl and

sulfoxide so when the

pure o2 gets administered to help with

her breathing

it would have undergone a chemical

reaction

to add an extra o2 molecule or an extra

oxygen molecule rather than an extra o2

so just one oxygen so it becomes

dimethyl sulfone okay

so it goes from sulfoxide to sulfone

all right so when that blood is drawn

out in the syringe

and then is cooled to a room temperature

crystals form which is what the nurse

saw is what they're hypothesizing

and then it's converted into

dimethyl sulfate no

but not outside of the body inside and

they think

that the defibrillation would have

caused that

oh okay they thought that the

electricity caused that

i guess there's a lot of counter

theories

about how it could have converted from

sulfone to sulfate the people that did

the original

investigation thought that it would have

happened naturally

some other scientists read their paper

and said that that was impossible

okay but again with this kind of science

and new cases without testing it in

vitro

in the body you don't know what kind of

chemical reactions

can happen or will happen under what

circumstances so

it's possible that it was from the defib

it could have happened

naturally without the defib but the

theory is that it changed from sulfone

to sulfate at some point

so what i read then was that dimethyl

sulfate

can cause convulsions delirium

paralysis and damage heart

liver and kidneys yeah it's a nerve gas

yeah has it been used like as a nerve

gas

currently the us have never used it

but as to how much trust you put in that

i will let you be the judge

but they do know that 10 minutes

of exposure to 0.5 grams

of dimethyl sulfate in a centimeter

cubed

can kill oh god that's so

little yeah so it's pretty vicious

and like you said affects liver kidney

heart it can cause cell death in exposed

tissues so you don't even need

to breathe in or ingest it or anything

like that it can

start killing your cells just from being

in contact on the outside of your skin

you can start

your skin can start dying so like all

nerve gases it's pretty nasty stuff

yeah which does kind of lead to the

theory of that

being what happened because the people

around her

got symptoms people around got symptoms

the people that dealt with her iv

and were closest to her suffered the

most

which makes sense the symptoms all fit

in convulsions paralysis and one of the

nurses said that she couldn't move her

arms the hepatotoxicity could have

caused the hepatitis

in the nurse in the icu yeah which is

liver

problems hepatitis yeah everybody knows

what hepatitis is

sorry and

also the necrosis in her knees the cell

death in her knees

yeah that she particularly suffered from

could have also been caused by that

the only thing that doesn't match which

the guys that did

the investigation did comment on

was the nausea so apparently it doesn't

cause any symptoms

of nausea yeah

if you're being ravaged from the inside

out by a nerve gas

then maybe that will make you feel a bit

ill

yeah i feel like i can feel

nauseous about all kinds of things

the smell of ammonia can cause nausea in

some people

so yeah i don't think that's a thing

that can be

ruled out just because it's not a

symptom of

nerve gas poisoning yeah and also

one other thing that i've read that

might not

lend to this theory is that they

couldn't find

any traces of dimethyl sulfate

anywhere afterwards and i think

that would have come down to the fact

that it would have been in small

quantities

even though they found high quantities

of the first dimethyl the dnso

before it underwent all of the chemical

changes they found a lot of that

did they yeah i can get onto them in a

bit

so it's possible that one they weren't

specifically looking for it so i know

that

the hazmat team went in looking for

certain things they didn't do a broad

sweep they were looking for specific

things so they could have missed it and

then later

could have broken down into sulfates

and the chemical reaction could have

reversed or it could have degraded

could have been cleaned away so again i

wouldn't say that just because they

didn't find

any dimethyl sulfate directly in the er

would mean that it wasn't what happened

okay i understand what happens here

but how did they found like dmso

so they did an analytical technique

called headspace gcms

gcns being gas chromatography mass

spectrometry

and headspace is basically so they took

samples from the autopsy from all of her

organs

and i think they used her blood as well

they probably used a more

technical method but when i was

at university and did headspace gc

basically you put

your compound in this case the autopsy

tissue

we used a paint tin that's how high-tech

we were

anglia ruskin university cambridge

um and you tie a bit of charcoal

to string put that at the top of the

paint in and close

the lid on top so if you imagine the

inside of your painting you've got the

bottom of the tin

you've got your sample on the top and

then a bunch of air

and then a dangling bit of charcoal then

you heat up the painting

to hundreds of degrees what that does

is basically volatilize all of the

small chemicals that are in your sample

so all of your volatile compounds

are made into a gas those gases

are absorbed by the charcoal you then

take your bit of charcoal and put it in

a solvent

we used methanol but any solvent will do

and you basically dissolve out your

compounds of interest from the charcoal

into that liquid

that liquid then gets injected onto

the gcns and the way a gcms works

is that your sample gets injected

the sample gets vaporized again by the

gc

into a gas the gas gets carried along

what's called a mobile phase

until it gets to a column and the column

will separate

out all of your compounds depending on

how reactive they are what their charge

is

basically chemistry shit but a larger

molecule

will stay on the column for longer

smaller molecules

come off the column faster etc etc so

you get a nice

what's called a chromatogram so it's

lots of peaks

on a graph that are unique

for certain compounds then it gets

passed to

the mass spec side where it gets

bombarded with a bunch of electrons

the electrons will charge

your molecule at different rates

depending on how reactive it is

and that will then give another mass

spectra

and the interesting part about mass spec

is that it is

completely unique for each compound

so you can't mistake a mass spectrum

fragment for something else it will be

100

identified or it will be unidentified

because you haven't got it in your

library

basically go on it's definitely

conclusive that she herself had put

the mso on where she had

pins you know yeah so the results of

the gcms found lidocaine

a very strong painkiller paracetamol

codeine also another very strong

painkiller

trimethobenzamide which is

an antiemetic so it's used to help you

feel less nauseous that was probably

given by

the doctors in the er and they found

dimethyl cell phone the interesting part

is that gcns can also tell you

how much of that substance

is there not just what it is

and what they found was there was three

times as much dimethylsulfone

in the samples as there was codeine

okay she was never administered codeine

in the er so she was obviously taking

the lidocaine paracetamol codeine for

pain

but she was also taking the diameter

cell phone for pain

and it was found three times as much

as the painkillers that she was taking

so it was definitely there

100 they identified it and it was

definitely there in a massive quantity

that

does make sense science bitch i didn't

know this

from what i read about like the articles

and stuff

i think that if they had been like okay

your chronic pain can be alleviated by

this

i would probably slather it all over i

have

no reason to disbelieve that gloria

heard somewhere

from a friend or advertising or

remembered from when it was a product

that dnso

is a topical analgesic she's in a lot of

pain

from a late stage cancer yeah she would

try it i have no doubt

about that it does make sense for you

listeners out there

i do have a his gel

that i got from you that i have been

slathering

on my back i wouldn't think twice

about like not using it yeah it's

exactly the same thing isn't it

a topical gel that you've heard from

somebody can be helpful so you're using

it you're trying it

so even though her family claimed that

she

wasn't using it one would they really

know

is it yeah like my family yeah it's just

a gel that she's using for pain relief

like

is that something that you would share

with everyone not necessarily

probably not no and then also the gcns

results

proved it that's an interesting point

actually because i didn't know

that they proved that she had used it i

thought it was

hypothetical either that or

the samples that were recovered from the

autopsy

have been contaminated with diameter

cell phone

it's possible because dmso

can be used as a solvent in chemistry

but i'm fairly sure that the lab that

performed this

are professional enough to have realized

if dimethyl cell phone was showing up on

their gcms results and it was part of

their

sample prep they would know that yeah

we can hope well they were involved in

doing

testing during the cold war the whole

company was developed

to help test nuclear warheads yeah

so they're a robust scientific group

i would think they know what they're

doing and so i would say

contamination issues are probably

not a significant factor yeah

and the fourth theory is that

the los angeles weekly new times

which might be the one that you've been

looking at maybe

i don't know had a possible

alternative explanation and they

theorized that the hospital where the

incident

occurred the riverside general hospital

might have been the site of a secret

lab and this is oh yeah i've read about

this

i just rolled my eyes at this did you

yeah

okay and they theorized that it was

a lab used to illegally manufacture

meth amphetamine so they're saying

that at the time meth chemicals

might have been smuggled out of the

hospital

in iv bags so what they're suggesting

is that one of the iv bags containing

methamphetamine

was hooked up to the dying gloria

ramirez

which triggered the round of nausea

headache

and other symptoms because the smells

and symptoms

are classic to mess fume exposure

this i'm not sure about yeah this is the

one i rolled my eyes out

for one the whole

theory of this is leaning on

nurses being used to smuggle

the iv bags out of the hospital

now maybe in a run-down

hospital in the suburbs of the middle of

nowhere

but this is quite a big hospital in

california i find it hard to believe

that medical professionals could be

bribed

particularly in california because

they're so health conscious

i don't know a lot of like i don't i

mean i get that

health professionals are underpaid and

overworked but

come on i was a health professional i

know

i have more faith in my transatlantic

colleagues than this theory lends to

yeah i understand but also

the part where they would have smuggled

out

like iv bags and stuff like that

isn't that weird for you like

okay we'll try a different tact then

if one of these mandy bags

was hooked up to gloria intravenously

she would have died instantly from an

overdose

okay then her gcns results

would have a ridiculously high

methamphetamine peak

which was not commented on she was

admitted

into the hospital with an irregularly

fast heartbeat

and breathing problems yeah if they

hooked her up to iv

that would have just skyrocketed

methamphetamine is a stimulant

so it's just gonna make her heartbeat

even faster

she's gonna struggle for breath even

more they would have realized

that she was deteriorating whereas

she didn't deteriorate she just didn't

recover

wasn't that what they said like she

wasn't

responsive to treatment she wasn't

responsive to treatment

but have you ever taken a caffeine

tablet

no okay so a lot of people when they're

studying for exams will take

a caffeine tablet to like give them a

boost

and whatever you take too many of them

you start getting shaky you start

sweating

you can't concentrate everything is like

on hyperdrive

if you're already suffering from

tachycardia

and you get administered an iv

stimulant your heart's going to explode

so if she was administered

iv methamphetamine her cause of death

would not have been

kidney failure okay her chest would have

literally exploded okay by literally i

mean figuratively

good to know mostly for me

as someone who doesn't know shit about

shit like science and stuff well i know

some

but not a lot i can do science me

yeah a little bit a little bit but not a

lot

the thing that speaks against this

theory for me

the most is that the fumes

would probably not cause

bone tissue death i don't think they

would cause

any kind of i don't even understand

where this

fume theory could come from the iv

drip doesn't get turned on until

the iv is placed so the cannula gets put

in her hand or her elbow

or whatever vein then they turn

on the drip and up to that point the bag

is sealed

there's no way for fumes

to even dissipate and if they did

why has something like this not been

seen before

yeah because surely they've just got

bags of

liquid meth sitting around in their

secret

bunker just doesn't make any kind of

sense either medically

or scientifically i don't know and i'm

speaking as an

expert on both

i don't think they meant like in a

secret

bunker i think they meant the doctors

and the nurses

were getting a bit of money from the

side you know

like yeah but it had to have been made

in the hospital

otherwise what's the point in the

hospital being involved

so if it was made in the hospital it

would have had to have been made in a

lab

if it was made in the lab but there are

stringent tests that are

taken by labs to be given accreditation

to be able to perform certain tests so

one they would have picked it up under

those

two there's no way for these fumes to

have come out from an iv bag anyway

so that's just ridiculous three if they

were gonna have

leaking bags or whatever that would have

happened in the lab

and therefore people in the lab would

have also suffered from these conditions

which has never been reported

ever okay i get what you mean but also

in america

all kinds of weird shit i know they like

to cook their own meth

i'm not disputing that at all i've

watched breaking bad

i actually haven't me neither

it doesn't make sense at all

i don't know i feel like maybe i'm

especially

biased because i've read so much because

trump sucks

i've read so much shit about like

america and their health

system but i'm like let's just well the

health system

is fucked because it's all about money

but that doesn't stop it from being

heavily audited and regulated so while

i'm

completely in agreement with you in the

the american healthcare system is one of

the worst in the world

and interestingly related but unrelated

the united states have the

worst record for deaths

during pregnancy in the developed world

oh shit but that's because of

money they will turn people away

at the door who are dying who don't have

insurance

think i read about it

as like uh statistically more people of

color

die from childbirth in america

i wouldn't be surprised by that at all

so all of you american bots that are

listening

listeners

at this point vo biden

unashamedly your health care system

sucks

no it does it does and the thing is and

your

orangutang of a president is making it

worse

vote biden affordable care act is the

only way

you people who are not rich will be able

to get health care

yeah and not vote means

if you give birth in the united states

not only does it cost tens or even

hundreds of thousands of dollars

depending on if anything goes wrong

they charge you for skin to skin

contact with your child that's crazy

if you want to hold your baby

after you have just popped it out of

your birth canal

that you have been carrying for nine

months

they charge you for it for a thing that

you have made

that's just fucking ridiculous yeah in

sweden

uk

how much do you pay nothing yeah because

you fucking carried it why would it need

need an operation okay serious

your life no problem

that people

won't call the ambulance an ambulance

crazy yeah i never realized when i was

younger

why so many films and tv

programs have pregnant women

in the back of a taxi yeah going to a

hospital

and it's because the taxi ride is

cheaper than an ambulance

yeah and it's crazy do you know how much

it is

for a ride to the hospital in an

ambulance in the uk

free of charge yeah which is what it

should be

because that's why we fucking paid taxes
