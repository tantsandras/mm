Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

It's happening. 

Are you ready? 

No, I'm peeing.

It's happening. \[Laughter]

\[Music]

Hit me with your rhythm dick. That means I'm ready.

Yes, yes. I understand English. I watched a zombie series that might not be a zombie series, might still be about a pandemic. But one guy got stabbed, and I think I've asked you this before, but then they have to stitch him up and they do that by soaking a needle and a thread in 120% vodka. 

120%?

Yeah, that's too much isn't it? \[Laughter] I think that might just have been the name of the vodka.

Don't need to tell you with your classical language education that percent is latin for out of a hundred.

Maybe it's just a knock off of Absolute, like 120%. \[Laughter] Oh well. And I feel like, is that alcohol content in a vodka enough to sterilize a needle and a thread? 

Yes.

Yeah. It's wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, and I'm your host Sandra. 

And I'm your enthusiastic co-host Joe. 

Today we're gonna do a Halloween special, which means that we're gonna dwelve into some cases that has been unsolved, unresolved or paranormal. We're also going to do that next week, because next week is also before Halloween.

Because October bitches!

This week we're going to talk about the case of Gloria Ramirez. I got my information from wiki wikipedia, journal.medizzy.com...

Do you mean journal? 

Yeah, what did I say?

Jooournal. 

Jooournal. \[Laughter]

Journal.medizzy.com by Dr Aiman Shahab, straightdope.com \[Laughter]. Sorry. By Cecil Adams and an article in the washington post by Christine Spolar.

I got mine from an article in discover magazine, a website called skeptoid and an LA times article that I forgot to write down. So I'll have to fish that out afterwards, but the full sources will be available on our website.

So Gloria Ramirez, a 30 (31 year old - correction) year old woman in California, was taken into the emergency department of riverside general hospital by paramedics, as she was suffering from both irregular heart rhythm and irregular breathing. She also had late staged cervical cancer but had not started chemo treatment yet. At the hospital the medical staff injected her with, oh god, diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam... Almost got it in one. In an effort to sedate her. Which I felt like was a bit of an overkill. Do they usually inject you with three different sedatives?

I don't know, I'm not a doctor. \[Laughter]

Fair enough. 

I think she had a cocktail because of...I don't think she was particularly responsive to any of the treatments that they tried, so they had to sort of combine it. But benzodiazepines, which all of those three drugs are, are quite common for tachycardia and irregular breathing patterns.

Okay. 

Because they make you sleepy. 

Sleeeeepy. Gloria didn't seem to be responding to treatment however which led them to defibrillating her. Which is the heart thing, right? 

Charging! Clear! Yeah.

Yeah. At which point the nurses noticed an oily sheen covering her body as well as a fruity garlic smell, which I can't think of anything worse a fruity garlic smell.

It's like crumbling some garlic over your custard tart. 

As well as a fruity garlic smell, which they guessed emanated from Gloria's mouth. A nurse, Susan Kane, withdrew blood from Gloria and noticed an ammonia smell coming from the tube. She assumed the smell might come from chemo treatment. That's what I read somewhere, which might not be true.

I think because chemotherapy is a technique that targets everything in the body rather than radiotherapy, which is targeted specifically at the tumor, you get cellular death throughout the whole body. So I think it's probably quite common for specific chemotherapies to cause breakdown of cells in the human body, which would lead to ammonium products being in the blood, which is where they attributed the smell to come from. 

Okay. And this is noteworthy because she hadn't started her chemotherapy yet even though she had, as it said, late staged cervical cancer. But they might have just caught it late. So she passed a syringe of the blood to Julie Gorchynski, a medical resident, who then saw what appeared to be manila colored particles in the blood. Kane promptly passed out and had to be removed from the room. Gorchynski then began to feel nauseous and left the trauma room to sit down outside, after which she also proceeded to pass out. A respiratory therapist in the trauma room became the third person to pass out, after which a small group of medical staff were left trying to save Gloria's life while the rest of the hospital were evacuated because they thought that something poisonous was happening. 

The rest of the emergency room, not the entire hospital.

Oh yeah, that makes sense, sorry. 45 minutes after Gloria had arrived at the ER, she was pronounced dead due to kidney failure, which they correlated to her cancer. So out of the 37 medical staff members who had been in contact with Gloria, 23 of them had fallen ill. 

Wasn't it 37 that were working in the ER? 

It must have been, right? Otherwise... 

Yeah, I think that's a lot of people to tend to one patient.

Yeah, that's true. Although it might have been just people who were in contact with her. So like people taking her from the paramedics to the operating room, people in the operating room.... 

She didn't go to an operating room.

Well, the trauma room, sorry. 

The paramedics take them there.

Oh yeah, that doesn't make sense. So I'm not sure. So now I have several different theories as to what may have happened around Gloria Ramirez. Do you have anything you want to say now or should we dwelve into the theories?

Or forever hold your piece. You could talk about the first investigation that decided it was mass hysteria. 

Oh yeah. 

Or is that one of your theories?

It's one of my theories, so I can... 

Okay, then yeah, plow straight on.

Okay so California's health department put two scientists, Drs Ana Maria Osorio and Kirsten Waller, in charge of trying to figure out what happened. These scientists theorized that the staff at the ER had suddenly become victims of mass hysteria, as their symptoms didn't match and because their blood tests afterwards had been normal. 

The main point that they found, what they reasoned for it to be an outbreak of mass hysteria, is that the paramedics who initially treated Gloria had no symptoms at all. Didn't come down with anything, they were completely unaffected. They also said that the majority of the people that came down with symptoms were women, and historically women are more subjected to falling under mass hysteria, which I chortled at a little bit.

Was that what it said?

Yeah. I think it was a journal article in a psychology journal in 2002, so it was peer-reviewed and properly evaluated, that said that women are more likely to be susceptible to bouts of mass hysteria.

Okay. I also read that more women than men, that had been around the area of Gloria Ramirez, did come down with symptoms. But I don't really get it, because I don't think hardened nurses would just come down with like: "oh I fainted in a trauma room". They're in trauma rooms for the majority of their working lives. 

Well that's what the lady who spent the time in the ICU said, and she actually sued the hospital for the diagnosis of mass hysteria saying exactly that. They're hardened medical professionals.

Yeah. 

They're not gonna swoon and faint at the sight of blood or a funky smell. Like how many drunks go to the ER and vomit on a medical professional. 

Yeah. People who are in labor they shit themselves all the time. Like, I worked as a elderly home carer, I guess is the word, or something like that, and the smells that I came across still lingers in my mind. 

Emergency rooms can get anything. They could have patients with gangrene, they could have burns victims, they could.... Like there's no way that these medical professionals would have fallen to mass hysteria because of a bit of an oily sheen and an ammonium spell.

It doesn't make sense to me. But what also doesn't make sense, or what doesn't lend to this theory, is that Gorchynski had spent two weeks afterwards in intensive care with liver inflammation as well as bone tissue death problems. 

I don't think necrosis and hepatitis are conditions that are typically psychosomatic, no.

And also, it can't just happen both at once, as like, an accident? Well statistically I'm guessing it can, but I'm leaning towards that it might not be a sound theory because of that. Because I feel like, that's too much of a coincidence to happen right after treating Gloria. 

Now I will safely say that I think the mass hysteria diagnosis is absolute nonsense.

Yeah, I felt like that was improbable, yeah. They also found in that investigation, people who had shown the most severe symptoms had all worked within two feet of Gloria or handled her intravenous lines and... 

Venus. You could just call it IV.

Okay. Which also kind of lends to the fact that it wasn't mass hysteria. But that's what they found. So theory number two is: the hospital had a history of hazardous gas leaks. Well, gas leaks they say, but it might have been a sewage problem. Because in April 1993, California occupational safety and health administration notified the hospital that the first floor emergency room was flooded with sewer gas from a drain. A citation was issued even before that, in 1991, when two employees sought medical treatment after a possible leak of hazardous gas from a sterilizer. Which, I'm not entirely sure what it is?

A machine that's used to sterilize surgical equipment.

So that was in that context, but I'm not sure it has anything to do with that, okay.  So in 1992...\[Laughter]. In 1992, the hospital was notified that an inspection had found algae growing in a water resorvo... reservoir. And the doctor treating Gloria had noticed some weird fluid in a sink and then when the staff started fainting, he flushed that fluid down the drain, because he was afraid that it might have something to do with it. I'm not sure how much that theory has anything to do with it. But another patient at the hospital before that, had said that he was evacuated from his room like a couple of times, because they said that there was something wrong with like the sewage. Did you read anything about this?

Nope. 

No, okay. So it might not even be a thing, I don't know. 

I don't think either sewage gases or algae cause the same range of symptoms. I know sewage gas can cause nausea and dizziness and things like that, the same as breathing in any gas because it displaces the oxygen, but if it were to be sewage gas it would have affected everyone.

Yeah. 

All of the medical staff, all of the other patients. If it were the algae then it would have affected anyone who would have used that sink, and if it's a sink in an emergency department it's probably going to be used by all of the medical staff. So again, why is it only affecting some of them and not others? 

Yeah, that's true. The third theory is that Gloria Ramirez takes painkillers, which are shortened as DMSO. Do you know what that is? 

Dimethyl sulfoxide.

Ooooh. Which was readily available at the time, I think, but then they took it away from the market because they were worried that it might cause eyesight problems? 

Yeah. It was originally issued as a medication, as a topical analgesic. So a painkiller that you apply to your skin rather than ingest...

So it's a cream?

More like a gel. 

Oh yeah. 

After a clinical trial showed that it was affecting people's eyesight the FDA, the food and drugs administration in America, took it off of the medical market, but it can still be bought from hardware stores. And this is slightly concerning, why people would buy their medication from a hardware shop. It's an excellent degreaser. So people working in mechanics that get covered in grease doing oil changes and things like that, rub a bit of dimethyl sulfoxide on you gets rid of it, lovely job. So it can still be bought from hardware shops for that purpose, but it's not advised to be used medically anymore. 

But was that the case at the time?

Yes. So it was basically a home remedy that she was using it for. 

Okay, but like, the likelihood of her knowing about it as a home remedy, would you say that it was probable? 

I see no reason to believe that it wouldn't be, given that it was established as a medical treatment previously, and we're not talking like 50 years previously, but maybe a couple. And people can get very creative when it comes to home remedies for terminal... 

Pain.

Or, yeah, chronic cases of pain. 

Yeah, okay. So before she died, due to a urinary blockage, the DMSO builds up in her bloodstream and then oxygen administered by the paramedics converts the DMSO in her blood to DMSO2. I'm not sure what that is, but... 

DMSO isn't its chemical name, it's basically an abbreviation. So dm: dimethyl, and sulfoxide: so. When the pure O2 gets administered to help with her breathing, it would have undergone a chemical reaction to add an extra O2 molecule, or an extra oxygen molecule rather than an extra O2. So just one oxygen. So it becomes dimethyl sulfone. 

Okay.

So it goes from sulfoxide to sulfone.

All right. So when that blood is drawn out in the syringe, and then is cooled to a room temperature, crystals form. Which is what the nurse saw, is what they're hypothesizing. And then it's converted into dimethyl sulfate, no?

Mm-hmm. But not outside of the body, inside. And they think that the defibrillation would have caused that.

Oh, okay. They thought that the electricity caused that?

I guess. There's a lot of counter theories about how it could have converted from sulfone to sulfate. The people that did the original investigation thought that it would have happened naturally, some other scientists read their paper and said that that was impossible.

Okay. 

But again, with this kind of science and new cases, without testing it in vitro, in the body, you don't know what kind of chemical reactions can happen or will happen under what circumstances. So it's possible that it was from the defib, it could have happened naturally without the defib, but the theory is that it changed from sulfone to sulfate at some point.

So what I read then, was that dimethyl sulfate can cause convulsions, delirium, paralysis and damage heart, liver and kidneys. 

Yeah. It's a nerve gas.

Yeah. Has it been used like as a nerve gas?

Apparently, the US have never used it, but as to how much trust you put in that, I will let you be the judge. But they do know that 10 minutes of exposure to 0.5 grams of dimethyl sulfate in a centimeter cubed, can kill. 

Oh god, that's so little. 

Yeah so it's pretty vicious. And like you said, affects liver, kidney, heart. It can cause cell death in exposed tissues. So you don't even need to breathe in or ingest it, or anything like that, it can start killing your cells just from being in contact on the outside of your skin. You can start... Your skin can start dying. So like all nerve gases, it's pretty nasty stuff.

Yeah. Which does kind of lead to the theory of that being what happened, because the people around her got symptoms. 

People around got symptoms, the people that dealt with her IV and were closest to her suffered the most, which makes sense. The symptoms all fit in convulsions, paralysis and one of the nurses said that she couldn't move her arms. The hepatotoxicity could have caused the hepatitis in the nurse in the ICU. 

Yeah, which is liver problems. 

Hepatitis, yeah. Everybody knows what hepatitis is. \[Laughter]

Sorry. 

And also the necrosis in her knees, the cell death in her knees, that she particularly suffered from could have also been caused by that. The only thing that doesn't match, which the guys that did the investigation did comment on, was the nausea. So apparently, it doesn't cause any symptoms of nausea. 

Yeah?

But if you're being ravaged from the inside out by a nerve gas, then maybe that will make you feel a bit ill.

Yeah. I feel like I can feel nauseous about all kinds of things.

The smell of ammonia can cause nausea in some people. So yeah, I don't think that's a thing that can be ruled out just because it's not a symptom of nerve gas poisoning. 

Yeah. And also

one other thing that i've read that

might not

lend to this theory is that they

couldn't find

any traces of dimethyl sulfate

anywhere afterwards and i think

that would have come down to the fact

that it would have been in small

quantities

even though they found high quantities

of the first dimethyl the dnso

before it underwent all of the chemical

changes they found a lot of that

did they yeah i can get onto them in a

bit

so it's possible that one they weren't

specifically looking for it so i know

that

the hazmat team went in looking for

certain things they didn't do a broad

sweep they were looking for specific

things so they could have missed it and

then later

could have broken down into sulfates

and the chemical reaction could have

reversed or it could have degraded

could have been cleaned away so again i

wouldn't say that just because they

didn't find

any dimethyl sulfate directly in the er

would mean that it wasn't what happened

okay i understand what happens here

but how did they found like dmso

so they did an analytical technique

called headspace gcms

gcns being gas chromatography mass

spectrometry

and headspace is basically so they took

samples from the autopsy from all of her

organs

and i think they used her blood as well

they probably used a more

technical method but when i was

at university and did headspace gc

basically you put

your compound in this case the autopsy

tissue

we used a paint tin that's how high-tech

we were

anglia ruskin university cambridge

um and you tie a bit of charcoal

to string put that at the top of the

paint in and close

the lid on top so if you imagine the

inside of your painting you've got the

bottom of the tin

you've got your sample on the top and

then a bunch of air

and then a dangling bit of charcoal then

you heat up the painting

to hundreds of degrees what that does

is basically volatilize all of the

small chemicals that are in your sample

so all of your volatile compounds

are made into a gas those gases

are absorbed by the charcoal you then

take your bit of charcoal and put it in

a solvent

we used methanol but any solvent will do

and you basically dissolve out your

compounds of interest from the charcoal

into that liquid

that liquid then gets injected onto

the gcns and the way a gcms works

is that your sample gets injected

the sample gets vaporized again by the

gc

into a gas the gas gets carried along

what's called a mobile phase

until it gets to a column and the column

will separate

out all of your compounds depending on

how reactive they are what their charge

is

basically chemistry shit but a larger

molecule

will stay on the column for longer

smaller molecules

come off the column faster etc etc so

you get a nice

what's called a chromatogram so it's

lots of peaks

on a graph that are unique

for certain compounds then it gets

passed to

the mass spec side where it gets

bombarded with a bunch of electrons

the electrons will charge

your molecule at different rates

depending on how reactive it is

and that will then give another mass

spectra

and the interesting part about mass spec

is that it is

completely unique for each compound

so you can't mistake a mass spectrum

fragment for something else it will be

100

identified or it will be unidentified

because you haven't got it in your

library

basically go on it's definitely

conclusive that she herself had put

the mso on where she had

pins you know yeah so the results of

the gcms found lidocaine

a very strong painkiller paracetamol

codeine also another very strong

painkiller

trimethobenzamide which is

an antiemetic so it's used to help you

feel less nauseous that was probably

given by

the doctors in the er and they found

dimethyl cell phone the interesting part

is that gcns can also tell you

how much of that substance

is there not just what it is

and what they found was there was three

times as much dimethylsulfone

in the samples as there was codeine

okay she was never administered codeine

in the er so she was obviously taking

the lidocaine paracetamol codeine for

pain

but she was also taking the diameter

cell phone for pain

and it was found three times as much

as the painkillers that she was taking

so it was definitely there

100 they identified it and it was

definitely there in a massive quantity

that

does make sense science bitch i didn't

know this

from what i read about like the articles

and stuff

i think that if they had been like okay

your chronic pain can be alleviated by

this

i would probably slather it all over i

have

no reason to disbelieve that gloria

heard somewhere

from a friend or advertising or

remembered from when it was a product

that dnso

is a topical analgesic she's in a lot of

pain

from a late stage cancer yeah she would

try it i have no doubt

about that it does make sense for you

listeners out there

i do have a his gel

that i got from you that i have been

slathering

on my back i wouldn't think twice

about like not using it yeah it's

exactly the same thing isn't it

a topical gel that you've heard from

somebody can be helpful so you're using

it you're trying it

so even though her family claimed that

she

wasn't using it one would they really

know

is it yeah like my family yeah it's just

a gel that she's using for pain relief

like

is that something that you would share

with everyone not necessarily

probably not no and then also the gcns

results

proved it that's an interesting point

actually because i didn't know

that they proved that she had used it i

thought it was

hypothetical either that or

the samples that were recovered from the

autopsy

have been contaminated with diameter

cell phone

it's possible because dmso

can be used as a solvent in chemistry

but i'm fairly sure that the lab that

performed this

are professional enough to have realized

if dimethyl cell phone was showing up on

their gcms results and it was part of

their

sample prep they would know that yeah

we can hope well they were involved in

doing

testing during the cold war the whole

company was developed

to help test nuclear warheads yeah

so they're a robust scientific group

i would think they know what they're

doing and so i would say

contamination issues are probably

not a significant factor yeah

and the fourth theory is that

the los angeles weekly new times

which might be the one that you've been

looking at maybe

i don't know had a possible

alternative explanation and they

theorized that the hospital where the

incident

occurred the riverside general hospital

might have been the site of a secret

lab and this is oh yeah i've read about

this

i just rolled my eyes at this did you

yeah

okay and they theorized that it was

a lab used to illegally manufacture

meth amphetamine so they're saying

that at the time meth chemicals

might have been smuggled out of the

hospital

in iv bags so what they're suggesting

is that one of the iv bags containing

methamphetamine

was hooked up to the dying gloria

ramirez

which triggered the round of nausea

headache

and other symptoms because the smells

and symptoms

are classic to mess fume exposure

this i'm not sure about yeah this is the

one i rolled my eyes out

for one the whole

theory of this is leaning on

nurses being used to smuggle

the iv bags out of the hospital

now maybe in a run-down

hospital in the suburbs of the middle of

nowhere

but this is quite a big hospital in

california i find it hard to believe

that medical professionals could be

bribed

particularly in california because

they're so health conscious

i don't know a lot of like i don't i

mean i get that

health professionals are underpaid and

overworked but

come on i was a health professional i

know

i have more faith in my transatlantic

colleagues than this theory lends to

yeah i understand but also

the part where they would have smuggled

out

like iv bags and stuff like that

isn't that weird for you like

okay we'll try a different tact then

if one of these mandy bags

was hooked up to gloria intravenously

she would have died instantly from an

overdose

okay then her gcns results

would have a ridiculously high

methamphetamine peak

which was not commented on she was

admitted

into the hospital with an irregularly

fast heartbeat

and breathing problems yeah if they

hooked her up to iv

that would have just skyrocketed

methamphetamine is a stimulant

so it's just gonna make her heartbeat

even faster

she's gonna struggle for breath even

more they would have realized

that she was deteriorating whereas

she didn't deteriorate she just didn't

recover

wasn't that what they said like she

wasn't

responsive to treatment she wasn't

responsive to treatment

but have you ever taken a caffeine

tablet

no okay so a lot of people when they're

studying for exams will take

a caffeine tablet to like give them a

boost

and whatever you take too many of them

you start getting shaky you start

sweating

you can't concentrate everything is like

on hyperdrive

if you're already suffering from

tachycardia

and you get administered an iv

stimulant your heart's going to explode

so if she was administered

iv methamphetamine her cause of death

would not have been

kidney failure okay her chest would have

literally exploded okay by literally i

mean figuratively

good to know mostly for me

as someone who doesn't know shit about

shit like science and stuff well i know

some

but not a lot i can do science me

yeah a little bit a little bit but not a

lot

the thing that speaks against this

theory for me

the most is that the fumes

would probably not cause

bone tissue death i don't think they

would cause

any kind of i don't even understand

where this

fume theory could come from the iv

drip doesn't get turned on until

the iv is placed so the cannula gets put

in her hand or her elbow

or whatever vein then they turn

on the drip and up to that point the bag

is sealed

there's no way for fumes

to even dissipate and if they did

why has something like this not been

seen before

yeah because surely they've just got

bags of

liquid meth sitting around in their

secret

bunker just doesn't make any kind of

sense either medically

or scientifically i don't know and i'm

speaking as an

expert on both

i don't think they meant like in a

secret

bunker i think they meant the doctors

and the nurses

were getting a bit of money from the

side you know

like yeah but it had to have been made

in the hospital

otherwise what's the point in the

hospital being involved

so if it was made in the hospital it

would have had to have been made in a

lab

if it was made in the lab but there are

stringent tests that are

taken by labs to be given accreditation

to be able to perform certain tests so

one they would have picked it up under

those

two there's no way for these fumes to

have come out from an iv bag anyway

so that's just ridiculous three if they

were gonna have

leaking bags or whatever that would have

happened in the lab

and therefore people in the lab would

have also suffered from these conditions

which has never been reported

ever okay i get what you mean but also

in america

all kinds of weird shit i know they like

to cook their own meth

i'm not disputing that at all i've

watched breaking bad

i actually haven't me neither

it doesn't make sense at all

i don't know i feel like maybe i'm

especially

biased because i've read so much because

trump sucks

i've read so much shit about like

america and their health

system but i'm like let's just well the

health system

is fucked because it's all about money

but that doesn't stop it from being

heavily audited and regulated so while

i'm

completely in agreement with you in the

the american healthcare system is one of

the worst in the world

and interestingly related but unrelated

the united states have the

worst record for deaths

during pregnancy in the developed world

oh shit but that's because of

money they will turn people away

at the door who are dying who don't have

insurance

yeah i think i've read about this and i

think i read about it

as like uh statistically more people of

color

die from childbirth in america

i wouldn't be surprised by that at all

so all of you american bots that are

listening

vote biden and bring back obamacare

the thing is we have mostly american

listeners

at this point vo biden

no i mean like oops i mean like

unashamedly your health care system

sucks

no it does it does and the thing is and

your

orangutang of a president is making it

worse

vote biden affordable care act is the

only way

you people who are not rich will be able

to get health care

yeah and not vote means

if you give birth in the united states

not only does it cost tens or even

hundreds of thousands of dollars

depending on if anything goes wrong

they charge you for skin to skin

contact with your child that's crazy

if you want to hold your baby

after you have just popped it out of

your birth canal

that you have been carrying for nine

months
