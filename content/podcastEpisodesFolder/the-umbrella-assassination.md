#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

I had some seaweed at some fancy-ass Australian brunch spot in London, when those things were still allowed. The fancy-ass Australian brunch spots, no I'm just kidding. 

Sounds real fancy. "G'day mate! For your starter today we've got something that some jobby just picked up off the beach. Enjoy that, you fucking cunt." \[Laughter]

Incredible. I didn't know you could do Australian. 

Everyone can do Australian.

I can't. Well, maybe I can. No. 

Well that's an invitaion right there. Abort, abort!

\[Music]



Okay. It is Wednesday, which means...

Do you not want to wait until I finish my burp? I'm like full-on belching and you're like: "la la la la la, podcast la la la". 

I had too much steam, I just plowed on. 

More heat, less foam.

It's Wednesday, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders and I'm your host Sandra. 

And I'm your co-host Joe. That will never cease being my least favorite part of this podcast. Me having to introduce myself. 

I can introduce you and you can introduce me. 

Then we'll confuse our listeners.

They will be like: "who's this dark testosterone voice? Must be Sandra". 

"Sandra was the guy?!" 

Sandra was the guy all along, we all knew it. I have the biggest dick.

Pew pew. 

That's the sound my dick makes when it clonks against the toilet when I sit down to pee. Wow. 

Poseidon's kiss. That's when it splashes back up after you've pooped and you get a little bit of bog water in your bum hole. 

Oh yeah, I've heard about that. I don't do that, because I always put down a splash pad. 

Yeah, me too.

Got to keep it safe. Be safe out there, kids!

I mean, your splash pad is more like a splash parachute given how often you clog the toilet.

I have some explosive shits, man. I don't know what to tell you.

Gotta make sure, okay?!

I'm a lady!

I'm delicate! Apart from one's shitting their innards out. The queen shits, you know. It's nothing abnormal.

You could make the case that my shits are abnormal

So are the Queen's probably, she's quite old now. 

True.

Doubt she gets enough fiber in that diet of poor people and prawns to be able to form a solid stool. 

Poor people and prawns! \[Laughter]

If you're listening Lizzy, please don't write to us. We're not interested.

Sometimes you are funny, man.

Queen Elizabeth II will not be writing to you.

Speaking of which, this week we have a very special fan pick. Picked especially by our loyal Russian bots. Here we go! \[Laughter]

This one is for you. Please do not write, we are not interested. Unless it is for review or comment, then please leave good review.

Yeah. And also, I should probably say, it was not picked by our Russian bot fans. But we do appreciate you bumping our numbers up. Okay. This week we're going to talk about the murder of Georgi Markov. I got my information from wikipedia, BBC News, About Forensics by J. Emsley, a Guardian article from 1978 by David Pallister, The View East by Dr Kelly Hignett and The History Herald by Richard H. Cummings. He knows the comings and goings of history. 

Oh god. \[Laughter] 

Sorry, I couldn't help myself. 

Yeah, you guessed it listeners, this is gonna be a long one. I got my sources from a couple of journal articles, a transcription in a meeting that was held between a leading scientist at the time and one of the pathologists who performed the autopsy. Ooh! And Wikipedia. 

Yeah, always there, Wiki-wiki-wah. So Georgi Markov was a 49 year old man who had defected from the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1968, where he had worked as a novelist and a playwright. And he wasn't like, just a normal failed author, he was very famous in Bulgaria. After his relationship with the Bulgarian regime soured, he was sentenced in absentia for defecting. He relocated to England, where he started working for the BBC World Service. And other things, so there was a radio thing... Oh shit, I'm on the wrong Wikipedia page. Radio Free Europe, I think it was in Munich, actually.

That's where it's hosted, but it's a free broadcast across all of Europe.

That was broadcasted also in the Eastern block. So this was during the Cold War, and he used this platform to, among other things, criticise the communist party that ruled in Bulgaria and the communist party leader Todor Zhivkov. He got married in England to Annabel Dilke who, I must say, looks a lot like Rachel Weisz. So I was like, lucky man. 

Good job, Georgi.

Yeah. The couple also had a daughter. On the 7th of september 1978, Georgi parked his car underneath Waterloo Bridge, as he did... 

He parked in the Thames?! \[Laughter]

It's not funny. Okay. As he did every morning on his way to work. Near the bridge was a bus stahp. "Near the bridge was a bus stahp!". 

A bus stahp?

Near the bridge was a bus stop, where he went to catch a bus that would take him to his office. At the bus stop, he suddenly felt a sharp prick on the back of his... \[Laughter]

Doesn't mean penis. 

Sorry, sorry. I wrote this myself, I didn't see the humor in it at the time. There, he suddenly felt a sharp prick on the back of his right thigh and turned around to see what could have brought it on. What he saw was a heavyset man with an accent, that was briskly walking away and hailed a taxi on the other side of the street. Some sources say that he could tell that the man had an accent because he mumbled an apology, and some sources say that he noticed the accent because of the way he was talking with the taxi driver.

Yeah. One of the sources that I read said that the taxi driver was struggling to understand the instructions of where he wanted to go.

Yeah. So Georgi concluded that the man must have accidentally prodded him with the umbrella he had picked up from the street, as if he had recently dropped it. Georgi carried on with his day and recalled the umbrella incident to a colleague after noticing a small red spot, like an insect bite with a swollen red circle around it, on the back of his thigh. And then later on to his wife when he returned home. So that evening, Georgi fell ill with a high fever and was hospitalized the next morning.

some people talked about it as if he was

vomiting

a lot did you read anything about that i

didn't think he started vomiting until

he was

in hospital okay okay he told the

medical staff

about the umbrella incident insisting

that he had been poisoned by the kgb

with a toxic

dart as he had been warned about there

being a plot

to assassinate him a couple of months

earlier

but the medical staff at the hospital

was

unconvinced by this and i don't know if

it was

because they just didn't think that that

would happen

or if it was something about his

symptoms

but i'm guessing it just seemed

implausible because you know

kgb i think they originally

diagnosed him with septicemia which is

blood poisoning

and so i think being a combination of

quite an

outlandish claim yeah really when you

think about it

as well as a clinical picture that

matches almost perfectly

with septicemia they were probably

reluctant to accept

that theory so even though they say

that the medical staff was unconvinced

dr bernard

reilly who examined him at st james's

hospital

had phoned the scotland yard about his

patient

and the scotland yard launched an

investigation into it

dr riley stated to the bbc that he

thought that it couldn't be cyanide

since

that would have killed gyorgy quicker

than the four days it took for him to

succumb to his symptoms in the hospital

he said that he ruled out thalium or

arsenic

as it would have taken longer for the

symptoms to set in

both cyanide and arsenic present very

specific side effects when you overdose

on cyanide or if you get poisoned with

cyanide you turn blue

in a condition called cyanosis which is

also where the

ink cartridge color that's why they're

all

cyan cyanide because they're all related

to blue

i think arsenic does something strange

to your fingernails

i think it affects your keratin

production so

there are very obvious clinical signs

for both cyanide

and arsenic poisoning yeah the doctor

concluded

that it must have been a toxin and then

at home

in a strange coincidence his wife who

had just read

an agotha christie book suggested

that it might be ricin because that was

the poison used in the book

so at the autopsy they removed a small

part of the tissue

surrounding the swollen spot on his

thigh

and found a small circular metal

pellet with holes in it in the tissue

and when i say small it was like super

small

1.53 millimeters in diameter

yeah that's extremely yes they're very

small

so the autopsy findings were

surprisingly

similar to an incident in paris that

happened

only 10 days prior where another

bulgarian exile named vladimir kostov

had come down with a high fever and been

hospitalized

in this case it was a failed

assassination attempt

as kostov survived they did retrieve

the same kind of small circular pellet

embedded in his back so the series about

how he survived or why he survived

varies

but i picked out some that i thought

were most

plausible it might have been a

combination of

cost of being shot from a further

distance away

than markov as well as him

having worn a very thick sweater on the

day

and the lucky coincidence of the outer

layer of the coating

of the pellet failing to fully dissolve

it was in his back wasn't it yeah it was

in his back

obviously because that's where your

spinal cord runs there's a lot

more bone protection there than there is

in the thigh

so it's a lot harder to get that pellet

to the same

depth yeah than it would be for a meaty

area like the thigh so it was never

going to be as deep

which you don't even need to accommodate

for the fact that he

was shot further away okay it could be

exactly the same distance but because

the location on the body was different

it wouldn't have penetrated as far it

was mentioned in a couple of the sources

that i read that

they all agreed he was wearing uh either

a thick jumper

or a thick jersey i think one of them

said

which obviously would have slowed the

impact whereas

gyorgy was wearing jeans yeah which is

just

one layer although they couldn't prove

with gergie that there was a covering on

the pellet

it has been implied that there was one

which did obviously fully dissolve

because they couldn't trace it

if the other one didn't then he would

have received a lower dose of

the poison as well yeah here maybe

we should talk about horizon i

think we should probably talk about the

autopsy first

yes hit me with your rhythm stick

i'm ready hit me so

as you said they found the spherical

metal pellet embedded in his thigh meat

wow

they obviously cut that out but they

also took an identical

tissue sample from his other leg in

order to be able to compare

what in air quotes would be normal

compared to

what was causing the problem well yeah

yeah the pathologist

that was looking at it the tissue sample

that got sent away

to the second pathologist that looked at

it could see it

visually in the sample tissue the pellet

yep and assumed that it was

a marker that the first pathologist had

put in the tissue

to indicate where to look or what to

examine microscopically

and he said that the whole case was

incredibly lucky

because if he had popped that out and it

has rolled off the table

onto the floor they wouldn't have been

able to examine it because

it probably would have been lost it was

so small but he managed to extract it

and they did look at it

obviously they measured it 1.53

millimeters

and it had two holes that had been

drilled into it

and the holes were 0.34

millimeters wide oh god that is

so absolutely minuscule can they even

see that in a microscope was it an

electron microscope

no just a visual microscope it's

millimeters not nanometers

here i go again with my science

but the fact that there were two

identical

holes of exactly the same dimensions

showed the pathologist that this wasn't

a natural defect

in the pellet so it could have been like

a ball bearing that you have

in bmx's or any kind of

wheel basically but they knew that it

wasn't

and it was manufactured this way because

these

holes were so perfect really

the original pathologist saw that

gyorgy had lungs full of fluid which

indicated heart failure

his liver was damaged severely

which would indicate blood poisoning

which coincides with the septicemia that

the doctors diagnosed him with

however they also found that the

intestines

the lymph nodes the heart testicles

pancreas and the lymph glands in his

groin

all had small hemorrhages in them

so they were bleeding out internally

that

would indicate that this tiny tiny tiny

amount

of ricin that they think was in the

pellet would have been incredibly

poisonous

no well i'll get onto that a little bit

later

i have another question sorry if i'm

interrupting you

the cause of death was cardiac arrest

no i think they originally labeled it as

cardiac arrest

okay but then once they dug a bit

further

i think they amended it but we could

talk about that a bit later as well

okay so he had a couple of

ecgs while he was still alive

obviously he can't do an ecg when

someone's passed away what is an ecg

a test that measures the electrical

voltages in your heart

oh okay during the autopsy they found

that his atria had actually stopped

pumping so the heart is divided into

four pumps

essentially you've got two pumps at the

top which are called the atria

and two bigger pumps at the bottom which

are called the ventricles

the atria pump the oxygenated blood

from the lungs into the ventricles and

the ventricles pump it

everywhere else to the body so they

found that his atria had stopped

pumping completely which means that he's

not getting

any oxygenated blood supply to the rest

of his body

because there's nothing to supply it

into the ventricles for it to be pumped

out

so heart failure was probably the

initial cause of death based on that

finding while

he was still alive they took

multiple blood tests obviously and also

found

that he had a white cell count of 33

200. the normal range is between

4 and 11 000 okay

so white cell count increases when

you've got

some kind of infection in your body the

white blood cells are used to

fight off the infection and at the time

of drawing these bloods and when the

whole incident occurred

they thought that this was a record

high level of white cell count in his

blood

so they were absolutely astonished to

find that it was

that high so that means they've never

seen that before i don't think the

doctors at the time would have seen it

before

i did try and find the world record

for highest white cell count and these

days it goes up into the hundreds of

thousands

so that is all i have for the autopsy

okay the question that i have now is

what do they know

about rising poisonings

do they know anything about how rising

affects bodies or can't they tell

because they can't

study it because it doesn't happen

that's a bad

question what i'm trying to get at is i

got the question

okay so at the time

of when this happened there were a

couple of places

that were looking at developing

ricin based chemical weapons

so there were a couple of institutes i

think there was one in

norway obviously the russians did a lot

i think the americans did some research

and there was

a research institute in great britain

that were all

looking at the viability of ricin

as a biological weapon so there were a

couple of places that were looking at it

but like you said because it's so

toxic there's no real in vitro studies

so

studies in the human body that they

could look at

to compare it now the pathologist

that was i don't know if he conducted

the autopsy but he was definitely there

gave a wonderful explanation of the

thought process

behind how they came to the conclusion

of ricin

and they basically thought of

any kind of toxicity or bacteria or

fungus

or nerve agent that could cause

death and ruled them out

based on clinical symptoms so they ruled

out

all nerve agents because a lot of them

will cause

paralysis or convulsions and they

act super quick so because gyorgy didn't

present with

any of those symptoms they knew it

wasn't a nerve agent

they knew it wasn't anything viral

because either his death was too

quick or too slow i think it was

probably too quick

and again a lot of his clinical symptoms

didn't fit they ruled out everything

bacterial

again through clinical symptoms and

because of time frame

bacterial cause of death is a lot slower

and

they also took cultures from his blood

and they all came back negative for

everything that they tested them for so

they knew it was nothing bacterial

or microbial and then that sort of left

them with

toxins and so they went through the list

of

known toxins and it's worth pointing out

at this stage that

ricin was always a contender

it wasn't one of the last on the list

that they were like well we've ruled

everything else out it must be ricin

it was always at the top of their list

because it matched all of the clinical

symptoms and time frame

but because there's no test for rice in

in terms of

a blood test or anything like that there

is now

but there wasn't at the time they had to

rule out

everything else i think there was only

one

other contender that it could have been

by the time they'd gone through

everything so they'd got down to toxins

and it was either between

ricin or something else and again they

ruled out that something else because it

didn't fit the clinical picture

so once they'd sort of ruled out

everything else

they were quite sure that it was ricin

and this bit disturbed me a little bit

so vegans

turn off now they got a lab

pig i heard about that as well and

injected the pig in a similar location

so back of the right thigh with a dose

of ricin

and monitored the pig for the same

clinical symptoms

and speed of death so the pig died

in 26 hours after being injected

showed all of the same clinical symptoms

as gyorgy did apart from vomiting

yeah so the pig didn't vomit

but they did note that it had gone off

its food so it wasn't eating

i don't know the ins and outs

of pig emetic system

whether it's even possible for them to

vomit some animals can't vomit

whether they have the same internal

mechanism that would stimulate vomiting

whether it's a built-in response that if

they are feeling nauseous they just

don't eat so there's nothing for them to

vomit up

can't comment not a pig farmer but when

we haven't forgotten cammy

pig \[ __ ] when

they did the autopsy on the pig they

found exactly the same

internal hemorrhaging okay build up a

fluid

heart failure that they found in gyorgy

so they were quite convinced that it was

ricin

they did note that the pig had died

a lot sooner than gyorgy did i think

he died four days yeah four days

after he was shot so the pig lasted just

over a day but also we can take into

consideration that the dosage

they would have given the pig of ricin

would have been

a lot higher because at that stage they

didn't know

the dosage that gyorgy had been

administered

so i think that can pretty much cover

why the pig died faster

and the fact that all of the clinical

symptoms remain the same

and all of the autopsy findings remain

the same lens

pretty conclusively to show there was

ricin

yeah now i mentioned earlier that the

rice in theory is interesting

because there is no test or was no test

for ricin

they couldn't detect it in his

bloodstream they couldn't

find it on the pellet it still has to go

down

as a theoretical cause of death yeah

they can't

say for sure that this is what caused it

even if they're 99 sure that this is

what caused it

because they have no scientific evidence

to show 100 they found this in his body

and therefore that was what killed him

yeah and i feel bad about the doctor

that i mentioned

bernard riley who was interviewed

because he was like

i always wanted to be a forensic

pathologist and then when this happened

and he treated markov

after everything he did come to the

conclusion that

actually he wanted more than anything

else

to be able to save people's lives

instead of just

looking at the autopsy and trying to

find out what

killed them in the doctor's defense

a lot of people might be thinking well

if his wife

had identified it as ricin yeah i mean

obviously you're not just going to be

like oh

you read that in a fictional whodunit

story well it must be ricin

if he had some clinical inkling that it

was rice in poisoning

i feel that it's important to point out

at this stage

that there is no cure for ricin

poisoning

because it was basically injected it was

intravenous

through his tissue straight into his

bloodstream all of your typical

poisoning treatments wouldn't have

worked

so one of the most common ones is

activated charcoal

which sits in the stomach and absorbs

the poison before it can be

absorbed into the bloodstream now

because he didn't have any in his

stomach that wouldn't have worked

ricin can't be removed by dialysis

so they couldn't have filtered his blood

artificially to get rid of it that

wouldn't have worked

so all they can really do is administer

fluids

and certain drugs that could have kept

his heart in rhythm

and helped his kidneys or his liver and

things like that

given the degree of internal

hemorrhaging that they found

in the autopsy i don't think there was

anything that the medical team could

have done

to save him yeah but for me it was

impressive that the doctor even

concluded that it was a toxin and also

impressive of agatha christie to even

think up that story i'm pretty sure

she's done this a couple of times

whether it be in her stories she's

thought this up and then someone has

done it

or whether a medical professional

has read that story and successfully

treated someone

i'm sure that this is not the first time

that agatha christie has been

or one of her stories rather has been

involved in a medical case

that is quite impressive she's quite an

oppressive lady

yeah i'm almost certain that it was a

doctor

or a nurse some kind of medical

professional

that had read an agatha christie story

and identified the exact same symptoms

of one of the murders in the agatha

christie novel

and saved the patient because of that

that is quite cool

the amount of research that she'd have

had to go into

yeah and at the time of her writing

that's like

so many trips to the library

yeah definitely if you don't get

the jokes they're all references to our

previous episodes

because we're not that creative to come

up with new jokes

yeah if i just like to pick something

funny and stick with it

okay so this is for you forest dwellers

that listen to every episode

that's for you suzanne

forest dwellers so according should we

talk about ricin

or do you want to do that in a bit oh i

thought we did that no that was autopsy

babe

oh okay

let's talk about ricin okay so

ricin is produced within the seeds

of the castor oil plant oh wait

castor oil is a skin care product

amongst other things yeah it has a

multitude of different uses

castor oil has been commandeered for

a million and one things the

oil company castrol actually came to be

by starting out in castor oil so

a multi-billion international company

founded themselves on castor oil

according to

the guinness book of world records it's

the

most poisonous common plant

in the world

i bathe in castor oil no rains

for all the paranoid hypochondriacs

out there castor oil is completely safe

to use

i just wanted to say my joke castor oil

no rains just oil that's the slogan for

my skin as well

okay that's not funny carry on

carry on i'm just waiting for the

tumbleweed to

roll bye

yeah so um the process of manufacturing

castor oil

removes all of the ricin from the

product so there's no concerns about

using castor oil it's completely safe in

as much

as an oil can be so

the plant that is responsible for both

ricin and castor oil grows

in warm climates it's a super common

plant

so some indigenous people used to

chew on the seeds of the castor oil

plant

for their purgative effects which has

been known to result in death

oh also the seeds of the plant

can pass through the human body

completely perfectly fine without

causing any side effects

unless you chew them okay so if you

break that seed casing

by chewing it or it being a particularly

weak shell in your stomach acid breaking

it down

then you will die but swallow them whole

you're golden pop them down like

sunflower seeds i think

normal people chew their sunflower seeds

just saying

\[ __ ] you the clinical symptoms

of ricin poisoning include a burning

mouth

and throat sensation abdominal pain

vomiting and diarrhea

so all of you conspiracy theorists out

there

it does cause vomiting yeah

stick that sunflower up your ears it

causes severe dehydration

and the inability to urinate

which is a nice combination and also a

very interesting combination

it can cause tachycardia which is

a raised heart rate and

a drop in blood pressure interesting

it's like you're pumping it on an empty

tank you're pumping extra fast but the

amount of blood you're pumping

is reduced that sounds dangerous to me

it's exactly what happened to gyorgy

because obviously

your blood pressure is going to drop if

half of your heart isn't working

yeah yeah because it's a bit like rabies

in the

it causes an insatiable first but also

a fear of water yeah that is

the craziest \[ __ ] i've ever heard when

you told me about that

i was like this is nightmare fuel can we

do a rabies episode

it's not going to be a murder but rabies

is so interesting

as a pathogen yeah and also nightmare

fuel

so they have done studies

in animals and the

lethal doses are super

super low yeah i did actually

clock onto that because i was like in

this tiny tiny little

metal ball with tiny tiny holes in it

must have been a very very small amount

of ricin so the ld50

little dose for 50 of the population

yeah well remembered i was just gonna

explain that for any new listeners

but oh sorry i was like i know this one

yeah so the ld50

for rats intra dermally i'll say

so under the skin rather than inhaled or

swallowed

is 5 to 10 micrograms

per kilogram so multiply that up

to a 70 kilogram person which is

the scientific standard i'm not sure how

many people weigh

70 kilos definitely not me anymore

so the ld50 for a 70 kilogram person

is 0.35

milligrams

yeah if we take into consideration

how much could have been packed into the

pellet

it's between 0.2 and 0.5

milligrams so well within

the lethal dose they've also found in

some studies

that the lethal dose can be as low as

0.7 micrograms per kilogram

so where the ld50 is 5 to 10 it can be

as low as

0.7 oh god also the way that it

works in the body is particularly

interesting to you scientifically

inclined people out there

so ricin inhibits protein synthesis

so it stops cells from assembling

the amino acids into proteins

which is like the fundamental level

of cell metabolism so basically

the whole purpose of cells in your body

is to merge amino acids into proteins

and then the proteins go about and do

their happy life business

so ricin stops that from happening

so it's causing cell death right

at the basic level of what your cell is

in your body to do

and the reason that it took as long as

it did

for gyorgy to die and why it couldn't

have been

some of the other things is because

obviously

when you're causing cell death at that

level it needs to

hit a lot of cells for that to have an

impact

it's been there oh sorry i was pouring

my beer and i was like oh was that a

question

that was so interesting i might just

have a little snooze

no sorry i was listening so

i was gonna say that some other theories

around this case are like oh it couldn't

have been administered

by an umbrella we can rule out it being

administered

by injection because even though

the pellet was so small it still would

have needed

quite a wide board needle so

the size of the needle would still need

to be quite big

compared to your usual when you go and

have your blood taken

and they would have been able to pick

that up on autopsy

they know that it was some

kind of gas or compressed

air powered device rather

than it being some kind of explosive

device like a gun

because one the pellet would

have morphed shape if it were anything

more powerful

than compressed air or compressed gas

and

there was no burn marks

on gyorgy's jeans which would have come

from

the gun powder needed to fire

a gun like weapon it couldn't have been

anything like a blow dart because

no human is gonna have the lung capacity

to be able to fire that projectile that

hard

so you quickly run out of options as to

what it could have been

and there's also been i think either the

ex-kgb

guy or somebody from the bulgarian

secret service

came forward and gave a schematic

of the umbrella and how it would have

worked i think it's

pretty covered now that it was some kind

of

gas-powered umbrella projectile

they also know that because of the

height that gyorgy was shot

that it wouldn't have been something

other

than a long thing

not not a long thing but if it were

anything

small and handheld why would he shoot

him in the thigh

rather than his shoulder or the back of

his neck

or somewhere where there's a faster or

easier to access blood supply

the easiest place to administer a poison

would be in the side of the neck because

it's so close to the carotid artery

which is a massive transport route for

blood so it's going to spread that

poison really quickly there's no logical

choice to shoot someone in the back of

the thigh

unless you were carrying something that

is

easy to just flick up a little bit

and fire like walking with an umbrella

would be

or a cane or something like that rather

than it being something small and

handheld

are you laughing yeah i'm laughing

because i just thought that you would

say

if you weren't carrying a long thing

we know it's a long thing because of

science

sorry so according to some sources

the prime suspect in this murder is a

man

named francesco golino a dane

of italian origin allegedly

he was a smuggler who was arrested in

bulgaria

and given the choice of either prison or

to become a secret agent

stationed in the west he was awarded

medals in bulgaria for services

to security and public order

he was questioned by the british and

danish police

in 1993 following which

he promptly disappeared

yeah there's a couple of other names as

well that i came across

okay i have a little bit more about him

though

first ah fine

so in the documentary film silenced

the writer gyorgy markov and the

umbrella murder

they interviewed francesco golino who

they found

in austria switzerland some

country they asked him where where are

you

where are you the murderer of gyorgy

markov

or not he said i have nothing to do with

this story

i'm sorry i wish i could give you a

straight answer

but think for a moment if i were the

murderer

do you think i should just say it the

real truth

you don't throw it away because it's so

important

but for your broadcasting you can just

say what you want

just like all the others but in general

why should one say the truth

what for you live so well with lies

isn't it or say nothing i think

his answer was a bit weird

it's very weird i don't think his

english

is very good so it might have been that

but i also think he's just talking

around the question

yeah he could make a good politician but

it also kind of sounds

like he could be guilty because he was

like but think for a moment

if i were the murderer do you think i

should say it

why should one say the truth what for

you live

so well and lies it kind of sounds

a bit like an admission of guilt but it

might not be

did you have other names yes

so i have three

names one of them is general

todderov who at the time

was the chief of intelligence

or the bulgarian bulges

he was sentenced to 16 months in prison

for destroying the case file

that involved gyorgy's death it's

important to mention

that this was after the fall of

communism

yeah so once all of these politicians

and

power crazy equal but more equal than

the rest

communists lost power they destroyed the

bulgarian

intelligence regarding this case another

was another general this was general

saveov

committed suicide rather than going to

trial for the same crime

and the final name is kotsev

who was a bulgarian spy widely believed

to be the operations commander

behind this assassination so

not proven but widely believed to be the

guy that

was in command died in an unexplained

car accident

so it seems like a lot of the higher-ups

of either the bulgarian secret service

or interior ministry mysteriously died

when spotlight was put on them regarding

this murder

the plot thickens thickens like

gravy with a little dash of corn starch

a weird coincidence is that the party

leader todor

shivkov his birthday was

actually on the day oh yeah that giorgi

got murdered to me it sounds like he was

definitely assassinated by the kgb

he was definitely assassinated i think

the order came from the bulgies

and they got assistance from the kgb

yeah

they do this a lot i don't know if

you've listened to

our other episodes

what episode are we on now 21 21 i think

19 of them have been russian

assassinations

they do poison in interesting ways i

\[ __ ] love poisoning those soviets

so the last thing i have is that in 2000

gyorgy marcov was awarded bulgaria's

most prestigious honor

the order of stara planina for

significant contribution to the

bulgarian literature

drama and non-fiction and for his

exceptional civic position and

confrontation to the communist

regime so i think

in bulgaria which is probably why

this whole burning of the case files and

suicides and stuff like that was a big

thing because i think in bulgaria

now they really feel like it was a very

unfortunate thing that he got

assassinated

even at the time his writing was really

highly regarded

yeah what are you going to do now sleep

some of us have got work in the morning

sleep asleep yeah

but it was in the room for a minute or

so

maybe an hour she was laying on the

floor being like

did you hear her she was in the room for

a minute

maybe an hour

i don't know what even is time

i can't tell anymore i don't even know

what day it is well i do

it's sunday because i know you were

gonna work tomorrow this is no post

no i knew you were gonna go to work

tomorrow oh you completely

missed the harry potter reference oh

\[ __ ] why are we friends stephen you're

like i know

right you're the one that gets there

butter jokes like completely and i

put one on a plate for you and you're

like herder vernon dursley herder

lord dudley well she was in the room and

she wanted the attention

but you didn't hear her right i didn't

hear and i

no that's good that's good she was up

sniffing my stuff

she was like oh beer i was like nope for

you

candy can't care all right let's end

this \[ __ ]

yeah we usually have a couple of more

upbeat things to say before we sign off

which was what i tried to fish out of

you

um i like um

so nice weather we're having

it's snowing in sweden it always snows

in sweden

yeah it was funny on the

call today with my family they were like

oh is corona

making you want to move back to sweden

nicholas was like not even corona

could maybe

move back to sweden they were like what

the \[ __ ]

it was funny sweden handled it really

badly

yeah they did they've never done a

lockdown have they

well apparently oh this is funny

apparently

my mother has been in lockdown

in her childhood in a syphilis

lockdown

a couple of people in greenland got

syphilis

and they couldn't contain it so they

just ordered

everyone to stay in their homes for like

i don't know how long but it was maybe a

couple of weeks

and my grandpa was like no i have to go

back to sweden because it was a

family emergency they were like you're

not allowed to live he was like

i'm married i have children i'm not

in some sex orgy situation

i need to go back to sweden they were

like nope so she's been on a syphilis

lockdown which is crazy it's a lot

sexier than a covert lockdown

she doesn't remember this or she didn't

remember this because she was

four at the time but her parents told

her that she they

told her that she's been on the lockdown

and she was like oh

what for they were like sip so

s syphilis

oh crazy okay thank you so much for

listening

to midweek murders we'll see you next

week

oh what's the point

what day even is it

bye

Love you.
