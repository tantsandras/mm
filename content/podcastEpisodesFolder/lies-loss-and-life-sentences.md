Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised. 

Hello?

Hit me with your rhythm stick, hit me, hit me. Fantastisch, ich liebe dich, hit me, hit me, hit me.

It is I, your friend and confidant.

Thank you very much for scheduling this tonight, because this is my opportunity to catch up on TV from the week. I've got an episode of Bob's Burgers, I've got the rest of Bly Manor, I've got two more episodes of Little Mix, I've got...

What?

I was hoping you'd skip over that.

Wait a minute. What are you watching? 

And then there's another episode of Lockhart Country coming out tonight. They're doing a show... \[uncontrollable laughter] All right, I don't even know why i'm bothering to explain this to you, you clearly don't care, you just want to laugh at me. How much of you had to drink, it's really not that funny?

Not much. Are you watching a reality tv show about Little Mix? 

No it's not a reality tv show. Do you need five minutes? 

Tell me what it is.

I don't think you're ready. I don't think you can handle it.

I can handle it. I can handle it. 

You sure? Because your voice says otherwise.

I'm ready. 

They're looking for their next support act, so they're just doing a bunch of auditions and vocal training for hopefuls to be their support act for the next tour. 

Okay...\[laughs] I tried to hold it in. 

Yeah I know, you sounded like you were constipated. \[Laughter]

Can you still listen to the music after seeing how they are? They might be lovely. 

They are lovely. \[Laughter] Actually, I'm growing to like the one that I didn't like more, so it's clearly been beneficial for her. She's welcome. 

Because it all falls if you don't like her? 

I mean no, but it can't hurt her life if I'm on her side, can it? 

Okay. How was the birthday party? 

It wasn't a party. 

How was the birthday meetup? Meeting?

It wasn't even as formal as that. Only me and my mum went round. 

Okay, why? 

Why?

Yeah. What were the other... 

Because the rule of six stops everybody from meeting up in the same house.

Oh okay, yeah, that makes sense. Did you get him anything? 

I bought him a fancy new slash old coin, because he collects coins. 

What kind of old coin? 

It's called a quarter sovereign. So sovereigns are made from gold, in case you didn't know. This particular coin, half of the gold is from modern era, so like whatever gold's available now, and half of the gold is from George the third's reign.

I don't know how long ago that was, but I'm guessing it's old.

Many. They only made 3 999 of these coins. So given how many coins are made nowadays, that are in the millions, it will be quite rare. 

We should pick up like metal detecting you and I. We can go around beep beep beep beep.

I get called I'm a loser often enough without taking up metal detecting. And also you don't like the beach, which is where most metal detectors go. 

I don't mind the beach. Why wouldn't I like the beach? I'm not a monster.

Because you get sand in your vagina.

I don't spread out and like shuffle about.

I don't need to know your beach details. \[Laughter]

 I just imagine you, when you see a beach, doing what a dog does when it's got an itchy bum. 

That is true.

Yeah so.. 

I do have an itchy bum so. No, that's not true.

That's cause you don't wipe properly. 

I do wipe properly! I wipe way too much, that's the fucking problem 

You're welcome listeners.

Okay... 

You should start the recording, or the episode, with just that. And then play the theme tune.

\[Music]



It's wednesday my dudes, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders, with me Sandra...

And me, Mario.

Joe. This week we're going to talk about the murder of Shanann, Bella and Celeste... 

Or Cece, as she was known by the family.

I got my information from Wikipedia, "American Murder: The Family Next Door" which is a documentary that you can watch on Netflix. And... oh lord here it comes... An article in The Sun by Fionnuala O'Leary.

Beautiful british name. That is an Al Murray - the pub landlord joke. I'm not just being outlandishly racist.

Do you know how Fionnuala is pronounced? Is that an irish name?

Judging by the surname it could be irish, and therefore we will just call them Finn. 

All right. And an article on medium.com by Shannon Ashley. 

I have

the same sources as you what the whip

the wick

the wit wiki the wit the witch

wikipedia and the netflix documentary

oh you watched it

it starts on august the 13th

in 2018

when shannon had been away

on a business trip and her flight had

been delayed so she returned home

at about two in the morning

and she got a ride home from the airport

by her friend

nicole atkinson chris was home with the

girls

on the next day you should probably

mention

who chris is because we haven't

mentioned him so far oh yeah

sorry so we can say this first

chris lee and shanann watts

were married and they had two daughters

bella

and celeste and shenan was also

15 weeks pregnant with little baby nico

yeah they had been together for a while

maybe we should also say that

the couple had declared bankruptcy

in 2015. chris worked at an oil

company and shenan was an independent

representative for a multi-level

marketing company

which is more pyramid as a pyramid

scheme or an mlm

sorry i jumped in there

pyramid scheme i know this one and i

feel like

people are five points to dumbledore

sorry you're doing great no i didn't do

that one on purpose

that one i kind of did i should also

probably say that

this is hard enough without me

interrupting you yeah i know i get it

i was gonna say that the mlm part

is a bit hard for me

because i like subscribe to this

anti-mlm subreddit and stuff

and i know how extremely

predative predative predative

predictive yeah they're very

they're prejudices horrible

companies that yeah

yeah it's a very aggressive sales

technique

yeah and they also prey on like house

wives

a lot and old people people that

don't have any source of income

and people that it's a bit tricky

because it does

paint shanann in a pretty dark light

but i would also like to say that a lot

of people

get roped into these companies

so i don't blame her but i think that a

lot of other people do

yeah i don't know what i wanted to go

with that

i felt like very uncomfortable in my

whole body when i tried to speak about

it and i didn't know what to say and i

was like

but oh well mlm bad yeah

so not necessarily bad

oh yeah that's a pretty pretty good

description i would say

the company leaders the actual people

that

make money out of these companies they

are the evil ones

i would pharaohs play now yeah the

pharaohs yes because it's a pyramid

sheep i got the joke

you're welcome so nicole atkinson

after their trip i think it was

a company trip for the mlm thing

yeah so they worked together and it was

described as a business trip

yeah she became concerned because

shenan had missed a scheduled objen

appointment and she did not answer

any texts or phone calls which was very

unusual for her because she was very

much obsessed on her phone yes yes which

a lot of people were in that day and age

two years ago you know i remember

so she went to the house and she tried

to

phone shanann she tried to ring the

doorbell

she wouldn't answer so she got concerned

and called the police which i think

is a good move surprisingly

good because it wasn't even like she was

missing

for a week she didn't answer her phone

for like a couple of hours remember she

had gotten home

that morning at 2 am and her friend is

like

oh no something is very wrong so an

officer arrived to the

house to do a welfare check at about

2 p.m so at that point it's

24 hours but still very quickly

12 hours 12 hours sorry my math

so an officer gets there and they

managed to call her husband chris

chris gets home he says that

he went to work at like 5 30 in the

morning

and shanann was still in the house when

he went to work

so they search for her in the house they

search for any kind of clues

no note nothing but accepting

no no car gone

all right mrs weasley apart from the car

was still

there yeah which i think was one of the

warning flags for her friend

that the car was still there but she

wasn't answering the door or anything

which i mean quite astute friend if i

had a friend who didn't

answer my text messages i mean i have a

friend who hasn't

answered me for like six months so much

the individual phone calls and text

messages that weren't replied to

but she knew she was pregnant and she

missed her

obgyn appointment which is

more of a red flag than not picking up

your phone

yeah although to be fair at the

frequency that

we're messaging if you hadn't answered

me

for 12 hours i would be

concerned i mean i don't get 12 minutes

before someone starts video calling me

for you listeners that's not true it's

13.

we do send a lot of reddit links there

give him the benefit of the dow

so the police gets there they talk to

chris he has no idea where his wife is

they find

her ring and then chris says that they

had an

argument but he was like it wasn't like

that serious so they were like okay

goes to the neighbor's house because the

neighbors

says that he has a security camera that

points out

to the streets where you can see shanann

and chris's house when they were

watching

the security camera footage

chris isn't really looking at it did you

notice that

so he's glancing at it looking and also

seems

incredibly agitated yeah for me

watching it because it was in the

documentary i was like all right

he seems a bit sketchy but for the

neighbor who knows him and knows talk to

him and stuff like that

he was like this is not his normal

behavior which i also felt like

that neighbor is very astute but he was

like oh

he's very talkative and he's very like

agitated

this is not how he usually behaves the

police officer

kind of brushes that aside and says well

anyone would be nervous if the wife was

missing kind of

i think the police officer paid

attention to it and it was probably

put in his statement but it wasn't like

uh

oh well he's acting super suspicious

let's arrest him now

he was given the benefit of the doubt

because his wife and two children

were missing so yeah i don't think you

can place any blame

on the police officer for not following

that lead i think

he did seem interested when he was

speaking to the neighbor

about the differences in behavior but

did sort of

not bring it to the main point of

attention

because of the circumstances which i

definitely get

but then the neighbor says something

bone chilling

and it was when he pointed out that when

chris

lives for work he's loading stuff in his

car

he can see chris backing the car into

the garage or something i don't remember

exactly what it was

but he says to the police he never

takes out his tools and from the

car

so it's always in the car yeah so that

video clip

of the car backing into the drive chris

explained that he does that all the time

because

it's a shorter trip for him to unload

all of his tools and equipment

from his van or truck into the garage

and vice versa

to which once chris had left the

neighbor

was like he never does this ever that's

nothing that he does

which is also very astute but also gives

me a bit

of the crips like how much did this

neighbor

watch his neighbors with a security

camera

no to be fair when you live in that kind

of

environment when you are in a detached

house

but you've got close proximity of

neighbors

you do know their behaviors because

you hear a truck in the middle of the

night and you're like oh what's this you

look out the window oh it's just next

door neighbor coming home from work or

leaving for work if for every working

day

of you being neighbors your neighbor has

never backed his truck up into his

driveway

and then one night he does and you've

got that on camera

it's suspicious and yeah i don't think

you have to be a peeping tom kind of

neighbor

to be able to note something suspicious

no that's true and i also want to say

that i'm not like

blaming him or anything i think that he

was very

helpful because it did lend towards

the case against chris the fact that

he was on camera backing his car into

the garage

i think it's good that he was like this

is not

normal only two days afterwards

after the disappearance of his wife and

children

chris was arrested by the police

well it wasn't going to be by the

chicken cellars was it

and one thing that led to his arrest

was that he was subjected to a polygraph

test

and this is shown very briefly

in the documentary but it was actually

a five-hour polygraph test and he

scored abysmally low

so he was asked about like his wife and

his children where they were

did he know what happened to them yada

and he sometimes

in that polygraph test referred to his

children in a past tense which is one of

those

dead giveaways and i know well maybe you

do this

i would guess you don't but sometimes i

listen to

like 9-1-1 calls when i know

that one of the people are

guilty in the calls and then i watch

like a whole breakdown of what does this

behavior and what do these choice of

words

say about the person who's calling

and one of the red flags in those 911

calls

is if they talk about a person in a past

tense it means that they know that

they're dead

even though he was like to the police

and to the media and everyone

he would say that i think they're out

there somewhere if you're out there

please come back by in the police

interview in the polygraph test he

sometimes would slip

up and talk about his children in the

past tense

which might not be a interesting detail

for you

but it was for me i think the whole

polygraph episode it was just rolling my

eyes

throughout the whole thing i cannot

believe

that in this day and age there are

institutions like the police force

like the fbi like the csi

that still use polygraph

as an acceptable form of evidence of

guilt in a court of law yes they do

admit it as evidence i think

it was to put pressure on him in which

case

it's a honey trap and again shouldn't be

admissible

there's no reason to be using

a polygraph you can get the same set of

results from a polygraph

as you can from just interviewing yeah

that's true

i think and because there's no forensic

evidence in this case i looked into the

polygraph

a little bit further so we're on it

you're gonna get that now

so the polygraph test is commonly known

as a lie detector test as i'm sure

you're aware

there's no such thing as a lie

detector test there's no physiological

evidence of when a person is lying

versus when a person is telling the

truth so

all of these wires and tapes that they

get you to put on your fingers and

across your heart

and you have to sit on a sensor in the

chair to

tell whether you're clenching your butt

cheeks or not genuine

not even making that up what i thought i

didn't know that

the butt one was a sitting one in the

documentary on netflix she tells him to

sit down on the chair and they have a

little discussion about it and she's

like yeah it's a bit weird

don't worry about it it's not on right

now oh

that's a sensor for involuntary

gluteal maxima stimulation

that's funny but what the polygraph is

actually measuring

is your blood pressure your pulse

your breathing rate and your skin

conductivity which is a

direct correlation to sweat so if you're

sweating

you're supposedly meant to be lying or

uncomfortable about something which is

why i could take a polygraph test

and would fail it because i'm always

sweating

yeah so basically the polygraph is

measuring

and i'm using this in the scientific

term

prepare yourself i'm preparing a

polygraph

measures arousal oh my gluteus maximus

just

clenched guilty

what they don't tell you when you're

having a polygraph or if you're looking

at a polygraph reading or any of this

is that a polygraph can be affected by

anxiety ptsd

nervousness fear confusion hypoglycemia

psychosis depression

highs from substances withdrawals from

substances and other strong emotions

yeah yeah so there are so many

biological reasons why a polygraph

result is absolute yeah

there is absolutely no reason in a

logical orderly scientific world that we

live in in 2020

or in this case 2018 that a polygraph

should be used and that's my rounds

about polygraphs over

i do understand what you're saying and

it is

inadmissible as evidence which i think

is good

because it wasn't i don't remember

they did arrest him on the basis of his

failed polygraph

not only i think that some of the other

things why they arrested him was

one there was no signs of foul play

nothing was missing from the house her

purse her phone was still there

her car which he actually raised in his

interviews didn't he

he was like i'm worried that she might

have been abducted by someone she knows

because there was no sign of struggle

and the police officers were like

yes yes you're right that's a good

point chris we didn't think of that

there was no sign of struggle

it must have been someone she knew yeah

i think they knew the whole time that it

was him

and also i think they subjected him to

the polygraph

because they wanted him to they wanted

to break him

yeah there is actually a series about

the invention of the polygraph test and

it's

very raunchy the series not the

polygraph

that's just a set of machines i think he

was

also arrested because he claimed to the

police during his

interview and the polygraph test and

stuff like that

he repeatedly said i have never

cheated on my wife i didn't cheat on my

wife

but his girlfriend at the time because

he was cheating

surprise surprise had contacted the

police

because she said and this is also

possibly not true but she said

that they worked together and chris had

told her that he was leaving his

wife but then she saw the news

about his wife's disappearance and

that she was pregnant and stuff like

that and she said

that actually i don't know this guy that

well

i'm gonna call the police and tell them

that we're in the relationship

and i don't know but it seems suspicious

but the police later determined as well

that she had been googling shanann

a lot before calling the police and

before

shenan disappeared so she probably

knew that she was pregnant and she

probably knew

that shanam wasn't planning on divorcing

her husband at any point because

apparently she had been googling

her insistently like a law

before the disappearance and stuff like

that i think you mean

incessantly yes incessantly

but what i would also like to say is

that

even if she knew doesn't matter in the

grand scheme of things but i'm glad

that she called the police yeah she was

a vital

cog in the whole arrest chris machine

and that's actually really commendable

because it's also true

like how well do you know someone that

you've met a couple of months ago

like you don't really and his wife

is disappearing pregnant and stuff

it's almost always apart

well it's almost always the partner

statistically speaking

not almost always but like a very high

percent

i'd like to see your coefficient

verification

and standard deviation for this

abominable claim

i don't actually know the numbers but

you could probably go through it

but the thing is i would also like to

say that even if she had googled and

knew

that they weren't divorcing and knew

that she was pregnant before

she disappeared it doesn't really matter

because she did

call the police and was like i'm

actually in a relationship with this guy

so he might be suspect which he was

definitely so during the

interviewing and the polygraph and stuff

and this annoyed me so

much but i know that it's like a police

tactic

that during the interview they were like

oh well chris

we know that women can be crazy

sometimes

did she do something to make you

angry i know that it's a tactic

to get him to confess but it did

annoy me that they were like so nice to

him

and that they were like maybe it was

shanann's fault maybe

she did something to the babies

and then you were like angry about

that did you see that in the documentary

i remember the women can be crazy

part but i don't think they ever

led with questions like maybe she did

something to the children

i think they did at some point but i

know

i think because that's not a policing

technique

that's a leading question and if a

defense lawyer got hold of that

interview tape

you wouldn't be able to prosecute him on

it yeah now

i'm second guessing myself but i really

think that they did

kind of lead him into that and then he

says that he wants to talk to his dad

his dad

comes in and he tells his dad that

shanann

murdered the daughters and then he got

angry and murdered shanann

and obviously this is a lie but

they were like oh are you feeling okay

and like

rubbed his back and stuff i was like why

would you

treat a murderer i know that it's

attacking it was his dad that was

rubbing his back

yeah but the police the police officer

squeezed his shoulder on the way out

but at that stage they were under the

impression

that this was like a revenge act because

his wife had just killed his two kids i

don't think they ever

thought that the polygraph lady

she rubs his back a lot well the

polygraph

lady isn't a police officer she's a

psychologist

yeah okay that's true it did rub me the

wrong way that they were so nice to him

because obviously they know that he's

lying about

never having cheated on his wife that

he had met someone new they knew all of

that

and so yeah i don't know we don't have

to argue about it but

i just felt like it was so much empathy

for a guy that

doesn't deserve it because i'm pretty

sure that they knew

that shenan never killed the daughters

prove it i'm joking you can carry on

so they wanted to know where his family

was buried

and after a lot of like interviewing and

stuff like that i think he was there for

a long time

he tells them where they are buried

so at his place of work they dig up

shenan

and the sheet that he wrapped her body

in

was on top of where she was buried and

then he also

tells them that he put his daughters

in an oil tank so they just interject

here

yeah so they knew that he worked at this

site

they spoke to his boss as a character

witness

so like they did all of their

investigation they admitted

the police this is in the interview that

they recovered that sheet from the site

where the are their forensics

officers what do you mean

why was that sheet not tested for

shenan's

hair or body fluid or anything

i think that they found the after

he told them where they were buried oh i

assumed they visited the site

before he told them like checking out

all of the leads and stuff but okay i

would guess

because he was arrested just two days

after

she went yeah it was all very quick yeah

i think that they just

went there to dig up the body more or

less i would guess

but i'm not i can't say for sure

so then they said

i think this is right but i might be

wrong you can correct me on this

but i'll do my best that they'll take

the death penalty off the table

if he admits to everything there was a

plea deal

involved if he pleaded guilty he

wouldn't get the death sentence

but that was proposed by

shannan's mum okay that wasn't the court

decision she

it was either her or a joint decision

with both the parents but they said they

didn't

want any more death if he pleads guilty

just give him life rather than the death

penalty

i think fair enough it's quite admirable

really yeah

i would also like to say that some of

the

reasons for why he was arrested so

quickly

was that he had called the daughter

school to unroll them from

school before he was even arrested

so they definitely knew that he knew

that they were dead

or gone yeah and then he confesses

that he and shanann has an

argument he kills shanann

by strangling her and then

takes the children with the dead body

of their mother in the car and says that

mommy's not

feeling well but she'll be fine takes

them to the site

and kills them there what later emerges

in his private correspondence is that

he tried to smother his children

before even going to bed so i didn't

know that

he didn't have an argument with shanann

he tries to smother his children with a

pillow

goes to bed has an argument with shanann

he thinks that he just murdered his

daughters

doesn't say that to shanann but

strangles her to death

and then his daughters wake up

and comes in when he's wrapping up their

mother

in a sheet and one of them is badly

bruised

and he takes them in the car and kills

them

on site where he buried the bodies or

where he buried shanann

and put the daughters in the oil tank

he also confesses in his private

correspondence

that he had planned the murders for a

while

he had also tried to force shanann to

miscarriage

by giving her opiates i think it was

oxy oxycontin

yeah that one but it's unsuccessful

so this was i think weeks before the

actual murder happened

but he definitely planned it he had been

thinking about it for a while definitely

what a cycle path yeah yeah

typical psychopath he was convicted of

five

counts of first degree murder unlawful

termination of pregnancy

and three counts of tampering with a

deceased human body

now some of you particularly

avid listeners will realize that there

were only

three murders but he was charged

and sentenced with five hmm

how is that so well i'll tell you i'll

tell you right now

he was given an additional life sentence

for each of his children as they

were under the age of 12 and he was in

the position

of being a parental guardian

and for some reason in the state of

colorado i don't know if it's federal

law but it's definitely a state law

if those are the circumstances killing a

child

gets you two life sentences i didn't

know that

oh well you're very welcome oh

yeah what did you say he was charged for

five first degree murder unlawful

termination of a pregnancy

yes so that was the other one that i

wanted to bring up

in some states in america

if you murder a fetus

by either killing the lady carrying

or an unlawful abortion

you can be charged with first degree

murder in

colorado and certain other states

they do not recognize the killing of a

fetus

as a first-degree murder charge so he

was charged with the unlawful

death of a fetus rather than

a murder charge on top of that oh which

he would have got

in certain other states he would have

been charged with

six cases of first degree murder in some

states

but in this one it was only five and

unlawful termination wait i understand

why you can be charged for killing

someone else's baby

if that is not their choice but if you

have an abortion for example

if it's an unlawful if you don't go

to an abortion clinic so if you go back

alley

and meet someone who isn't a registered

licensed doctor that person can be

charged

either with first degree murder or

unlawful termination of a pregnancy oh

okay depending on which state you're in

yeah which is why

it's always a debate in the u.s as to

whether

a fetus constitutes human life

and whether abortion should be legal etc

etc

yeah obviously abortion should

definitely be legal

abortion is a right yes we are

pro-abortion

we're pro-abortion we're from the bronx

if a woman wants to get an abortion she

should get an abortion

that's her choice

oh that's funny we're pro-choice is what

we're trying to say

yeah and it shouldn't even be pro-life

because yeah all of you republican

bot listeners out there that are

pro-life

you oh god

i think there was something else that i

wanted to say

yes another thing that annoyed me a lot

with the documentary

we should have said spoilers for the

documentary at the start

but we're too deep in now spoilers

just cut it and put it where you need it

i found it

extremely annoying that during the

victim statements that they have

when shenan's family can get up

and i think i know what you're going to

say yeah

and they tell chris that this is not

okay this is horrible

we love them you took away our child

our grandchildren blah blah blah which i

think

is important probably because the

victims

get a chance to express

what this has cost them

and i feel like that probably has a

therapeutic

yeah it could be quite cathartic yeah

which is good and also because he's a

dick and he should know that killing his

old family

wasn't just that's not how you get out

of a marriage

no get him divorced

coward

but when his parents get up

and his mom is like we forgive you

i'm like that's not something you

are allowed to do no i also like how

they cut

to shenan's dad after she said that and

the

look of disbelief on his face yeah he's

like are you serious

this guy has just murdered your

grandchildren

and your daughter-in-law and you're like

oh it's such a troubled soul

we forgive you oh you poor baby

that he's like you're kidding me

god

it made my blood boil i'm like

you're not allowed to do that

because it's not your child and

well it is their grandchildren but

hell like i get it if her family

were like oh we forgive you because we

have to do that

for our own sake but his parents

are like you know well they never

liked her in the first place

to summarize i would just like to say

to chris watts if he ever hears this

which here comes

he would never but i hope you rot in

jail for the rest of your life

because although good bloody job

with your weight loss you did look

much better than when you were a

chubby psychotic bastard

good lord but i feel like that was

probably the beginning of the end

in which case that is not a reason to

get fit yeah

to murder your wife and children no

definitely not of all the motivations

you can have it's a strong one

but not really sustainable it out

what a monster

what are you gonna do now i think ollie

does need another wii he's been

pestering me for like the last half an

hour

oh oh do you want to know something nice

been here for the whole recording

a little psychopath kitty yeah she just

came in

and sat with me for the whole recording

i'm like oh

oh i like the sound of your voice is

what poodle is saying yeah

i had a video call with my friend jacob

and he was like yeah i heard myself in

english and i was like in hell i

sound so professional

and i'm like that's so unfair because my

register goes up when i'm speaking

english like i have a much deeper and

more pleasant

voice in swedish when you're sounding

swedish

and then when i speak in english my

register just goes up and i

sound like a child i sound like a little

squeaky bear

speak speak english and everybody hears

me especially the dolphins

and then i speak swedish and only the

whales can

hear me

i think it's also more like noticeable

when i edit the episodes because you

have a very deep voice and then i'm like

over here like hello

what about if i speak like this

would that be more helpful for you in

your editing tones

it's a little bit more shirley bassy and

a little bit

less tom jones

those are two very famous welsh singers

\[Music]

because because i didn't know about

cornish i'm not

\[Laughter]

you know nothing about great britain i

know that's true

we'll fight them on the beaches we will

fight them

in the air i i don't know the rest of

churchill's speech

good try it's almost there we will fight

them on the beaches

we will fight them in the air

we will fight them on the land

we will destroy the nazis sarge

okay should we say goodbye to the

listeners
