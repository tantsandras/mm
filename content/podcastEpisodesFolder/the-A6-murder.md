The case discussed is The A6 Murder, a.k.a the murder of Michael Gregsten and the attempted murder of Valerie Storie. Joe (the lackey sitting in the corner) explains the DNA evidence and Sandra talks about why her mum thinks she has brain damage. Sandra got her information from The Telegraphs obituary on Valerie Storie, a documentary called "Horizon the A6 murder" and wikipedia. Joe got his information from wikipedia (the morris minor photo and the photo of James Hanratty is also from there, you can find it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hanratty)) as well as a BBC News article written by Peter Gould.



#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content,
listener discretion is advised. Okay
should we
do this shit? Probably should, otherwise
you're gonna have like
three hours of bullshit. Yeah.
And by bullshit I mean conversation,
lovely catching up.
It's wednesday my dudes and you're
listening to midweek murders,
which means that it's time to talk about
crime. I'm your host Sandra and....
Oh shit was that me? Yeah.
I'm Joe.
I don't know what I was meant to say, you
left me, you bashed me into a corner on
that one.
I am your host Sandra and,
I said and really passive aggressively.
Okay, here we go.
We're your hosts Sandra and Joe.
No i'm your host Sandra, and I'm the
lackey that sits in the corner.
Herdigurr.
Okay, let's do it again.
It's wednesday my dudes and

break, get some coffee, we'll be back in
five.
\[Laughter] It's wednesday my dudes and you're
listening to midweek murders, it's time
to talk about crime with your hosts
Sandra and Joe
\[Music] 



I had much more technical know-how than...
Yeah, let's just ease into that insult
shall we.
Okay. Good way to start. One minute in, and you've
already slandered your co-host,
it's gonna be a good one listeners!
The case we're going to discuss today is
the A6 murder,
which I found particularly interesting.
Do you want me to do the introduction?
Sure, take it away. So
I got my information from the telegraph
and their obituary on Valerie Story
when she died, because there was not a
lot of information from the
victims, which I found weird.
And also horizon
the A6 murder documentary.
And I also got my information
from wikipedia, I also got my information
from the wiki wikipedia.
A BBC news article written in 2010
by a Mr Peter Gould.
Knows how to write an article, I'll tell
you that. So Valerie
Story was an assistant at the road
research laboratory where she met
mike's, mike, michael. Really?
Michael very, very common name Michael.
Shouldn't really be struggling with that
one. No, I read,
I wrote Mike and then I said Mike,
Michael.
Where she met Mike
Gregston, who was a scientist at the road
research laboratory and they had their
first date
on december 1957.
And what it said was that they had
shared
interests such as cars, concerts,
the theater, and serious
music. Which i still don't know what that
means.
Oh yeah, you don't want any of this
relaxed music.
What the fuck is serious music?
Uh people that don't do it for a hobby.
\[Laughter] If you're to make music you've got to do
it one hundred percent.
I don't know if that's like... Yeah like if
our jingle is anything to go by that's a
100 %
proven statement of fact.
I actually really like our jingle, I
think that's the best part. 
Gregsten left his wife in 1959,
she was pregnant. In march
1961 he sold his
car because of financial troubles and
borrowed his aunts morris minor
classic, and in august 20,
is that a word 22?
22nd.
\[Laughter] 



Him and valerie was in the car,
they had gone to a pub before, and then
they went into the car,
and then they drove off to a place where
they felt was kind of secluded and
had sex. And then after dressing
a gunman knocked on their window
and he said this is a hold up i'm a
desperate man
they drove around after that for hours
some say like almost six hours or more
than six hours
and he chatted insistently
no insisted incessantly
he was chattering all the time
and he had a very distinctive cockney
accent
during this discussion which like mostly
consists of him lamenting about things
and like giving them directions and then
changing his mind
and then changing his mind again and was
like yeah
we're gonna go this way that way i think
it's quite important to mention
also that in almost every single
documented explanation of this case
people make note of his accent and how
he would pronounce
specific words so think words like think
he would pronounce with an f think
i think that's quite important to note
at this stage of the story
yeah he did have a cockney accent which
i couldn't find a video or a audio
recording
of his accent. He should be like
how you doing, what we're doing today
mate.
You're going down the docks, no, I'm not
going down the docks, I'm going
down the apples and pears. I've got a
monkey to spend.


Did i tell you about the the one
time where i had a problem with the
flat i don't remember what it was but
there was something
wrong that i had to
email the last immigrants living in it
me that i had to tell the landlord about
so it was probably something big and
then
there was a person coming around and
there was this was maybe
in the first year that i lived here and
he talked to me he came
knocking on my door i had no preparation
for it
i didn't know that he was gonna come
and he talked to me and i couldn't
understand
a word that he was seeing and i think he
had a cockney accent
as well and i was they have his tools in
his skyrocket
well i understand you when you say those
words
but it didn't look like a sky rock it is
no what exactly is cockney rhyming slang
in it
skyrocket for pocket
oh okay
stairs
\[Laughter] but james blunt is very funny on twitter
yeah opinions may vary
no he is he's really funny other
musicians are available
\[Laughter] he did uh once make someone uh no
wait that's not true he uh took
he served in the military and um took
his guitar with him
and strapped it to the side of his tank
while he was driving
through a war zone why
it's a fun little james blunt fact for
you
i was going to say that he made someone
get out of the tank so that he would
have room inside the tank for the guitar
but that's just pure fabrication.
That's not at all what we deal with.
We do. 

So they drove around
for hours and he directed them into
bedfordshire on the a6
and they stopped on his direction at a
lay by
at deadman's hill at 3 am
he shoots michael grigston
twice in the head and he does
and then he forces valerie's story to
show him how the car's gears work
and then he rapes valerie storie and
then he pretends that he's walking away
but then he gets back and shoots her
five times
in the chest area and the neck
so he shoots at her seven times but
uh only five of them hit yeah
the pedants out there who are
cross-referencing
at the first shot or the second i don't
remember
she does pretend to be dead and then he
comes back
and shoots her five more times uh and
she becomes paralyzed from the neck down
yes and the thing that i would like to
know
here is that i found her particularly
inspiring because she did like try to
fight him
and also when he knocked on the window
and
said i'm a desperate man this is a hold
up
she said to michael like drive off but
she didn't
but i do feel like she did really really
fight which is not like sorry
no i mean like it's not like a a trauma
response
is different every time and you can't
count on it being like productive
but she was extremely smart
during that whole time yeah so she
she was also instructed to remove
michael gregston from the car which is
why she was outside when she was shot
herself
and before she was shot she again
attempted to negotiate
with hanratty in terms of money and
secrecy
and uh he could take the car and he
could have
all of the cash that they had on them it
wouldn't be a problem
she wouldn't report him it obviously
wasn't enough to change his mind
um and she also fought him
before being raped and got
his handgun out of his hand
and then he took it back she was much
more in her own self or
did much more than i think anybody would
do.


So the scotland yard got on the case
and on the documentary did you watch the
donkey pantry
i did not i don't want to be a dick but
their
choices of music was extremely
weird did they play hey
they had like
\[Music] they had like a sequence they were
searching around the car
with like you know metal detectors and
whatever
and they played like this really upbeat
music,
and I was like this is weird.
But he forced Valerie story
to show him the gears and the lights and
everything
how the car worked he drove off
and then they found the car the police
officers
found the car they searched inside the
car
they didn't find prints they didn't find
blood, they didn't find hairs,
nothing that would like point to the
killer...
Can i just read the paragraph on the
wikipedia?
Okay, so it says in the evening of
thursday the 24th of
august the murder weapon a 0.38 revolver
was discovered under the backseat of a
36A
london bus, fully loaded and wiped clean
of fingerprints
with the gun was a handkerchief which
provided dna evidence many years later
the police the police
back the police issued an appeal
to boarding housekeepers to report any
unusual or suspicious
guests the manager of the alexandre
court hotel
reported a man who had locked himself in
his room for five
days after the murder and the police
picked him up
the suspect falsely identified himself
as frederick durrant
he was actually peter alphon a drifter
surviving on an inheritance
claimed he had spent the evening of the
22nd of august with his mother
and the following night at the vienna
hotel made a veil
the police quickly confirmed this and
alphon was released
the problem with that was that they had
seared in on the suspect and then they
noticed
that he probably wasn't the guy so they
tried to find another
suspect but i think he was he had given
his name
as something else than James Hanratty.
yeah wrong it was like ryan ryan
yeah so at the first stage
they did provide an identity parade
which is weird for me as a swedish
person i'm like what is an identity
parade
and they had provided that for valerie's
story
and she had picked out an entirely
different person
than peter alvon and then
they were like well probably this isn't
the person
so they looked at the other people
staying at the hotel
and they picked up james hanrady
which was under a suit on him and she
picked him out after like 15 to 20
minutes
after hearing also their voices.


The order of events is the murder
they then go and speak to
the hoteliers around the local area and
ask if there are any suspicious suspects
the hotelier says that han ratty was
staying in the basement
but alfond was in a room and he was in
there for five days
completely locked up after the murder
that's when alfond becomes primary
suspect
then they do the identity parade
the police state publicly
that alphon is the primary target
he's the person they think is
responsible for the murder
the identity parade doesn't match
alphonse she picks
Hanratty then the hotelier changes his
story
and says no actually it was han ratty
that was staying
in the basement room the only reason i
told you it was alphon
was because i wanted to help your case
well no that's not
entirely true because the first identity
parade
valerie story picks out a person that
was
a volunteer for the identity parade
she does so it's after the identity
parades and where they get
han ratty to say be quiet i'm thinking
in his accent
so whatever identity parade that is
whether it's 1 2
25 or 30. it's the second one my point
was it doesn't matter which
identity parade is the point is the
identity parades make the hotelier
change his story.
Yeah, and after hearing the voices, and
after like
15 to 20 minutes of deliberating,
she said Hanratty is the culprit.
So after that the police
zero in on James Hanratty
and they singled him out
as the perpetrator. So
James Hanratty and his family says that
he had nothing to do with it, but
before this James Hanratty had
been a petty criminal. He also had been
diagnosed
as a psychopath twice
in his life. He had been institutionalised. 



Yeah,
yeah, at his school the
nun said that he was not intelligent
enough to learn anything. I also
read statements from his former
classmates and such that said that he
was not
dumb, he was illiterate, he never
learned how to read and such. But they
also said that he was
mostly lazy, and also
popular because he would buy his
classmates
like candy and such. And I'm like
well that's relatable, I also buy my
friendships, but it's not like
it says much... Not quite as a disguise for
your psychopathy.
No I feel like it's not like a thing
that can say that well he was a really
good
guy no he wasn't he just like bought
his friendships which again it's still
slightly different
if you were a suspect
which is also funny because on the
wikipedia it said that
james hanratty had brain damage
he was in a coma for 10 hours
following a bicycle accident and this
is very common for serial killers.
I'm not saying that he has to be a
serial killer
obviously, because i've had like seven to
nine
concussions. And my mom is like that's
why you can't remember anything.
But also I remember when we went, when I
went to visit you in munich,
we went to the egyptian museum and I was
like
"uh yeah and this happened to that ruler,
and that happened to that ruler, and the
pharaoh of
this period was blah blah blah blah blah".
I just think my mom says that I have
brain damage
because I don't remember much of my
childhood.
But I think I just remember other things.
I don't remember
why people would visit Salisbury,
but I remember like facts about ancient
civilizations, and I remember harry
potter
trivia, I just don't remember much of my
childhood.
Well a lot of serial killers do have
brain damage,
so maybe that's like a thing.
Maybe that's something to look forward
to.
I mean like, maybe he had brain damage
from his bicycle accident
but... Remember kids, always wear a helmet.
I mean that it's a link
between him and others killers that they
do have
recorded brain damage, like hospitalized
brain damage.
He might have changed, and
their insistence that he was not
a criminal is a bit weird.
He was a criminal, he had been when he
got into that car.
Which we assume is true at this point.
He said i have been on the run for
five months. James Hanratty
at that time had been out of jail
for four months. It does
kind of make sense. He also
got in the car wearing a three-piece
suit and a handkerchief over his face,
so she could see his eyes, his eyebrows
and part of his nose, but she couldn't
see anything else.


I did watch a clip
on youtube where they interviewed
Peter alfond and he
said that "well I did it", and the
interviewer
keeps like pressing him on the statement
from the
victim, Valerie Story, that was like
well she said that he had blue eyes. He
was like
"well nobody has blue eyes, I've never met
anyone with blue eyes, big blue eyes".
I, for the readers, I have blue
eyes.
And also the interviewer had blue eyes
at the time, and he was like "well I have
blue eyes".
And he was like "well I did it", and he
keeps pressing
him on the key points, being like Valerie
said that the perpetrator had a cockney
accent. He was like
hmm he's got a cockney accent.
Apologies to any cockney listeners.
He kept claiming that he had done it
years and years after James
Hanratty was hanged for this. He kept
claiming that until the
70s, didn't he? Something like that, in 1976 he was
still insisting
that it was him that did it. Yeah
which I feel a bit like... the interviewer
said that he was
sick exhibitionist, that he just
wanted the credit for it. The fact that
they
stayed at the same hotel is weird,
the fact that he was at the pub where
Valerie and Michael went before getting
into the car
is weird. But I
don't think that the cockney accent,
that was the main identifier
of her perpetrator. And like,
also the fact that a friend
to James Hanratty said that
James said that the best
way to hide stolen goods
is beneath a seat on the
36 bus, or any bus, I don't know.
But they did find the murder weapon and
handkerchief underneath the seat in the
bus.
Yes they did. After watching the
documentary
and reading about it, I feel like why
did they check the bus garage
and the 36a bus?
They checked the bus because the
hotelier
gave specific evidence that said
a strange acting person
had specifically requested the
bus route of a 36 bus.
So his statement to the police was
only about the 36 bus but the actual
request was about a 36A, so I assume they
checked
all of that line of buses.
Probably. That proviso of evidence.


James Hanratty was one of the last
people to be hanged or put to death
by the british government. And
he said "I'm innocent, you need to
prove my innocence" to his dad.
And his dad and his brother and his mom
tried to do that, but I also feel like...
I totally relate with Valerie Story,
she said in her obituary,
she said that she didn't hold
any ill will to the Hanratty family. But
she did find it very untasteful
that they kept trying to prove his
innocence,
which I feel like is the most british
statement of all time. Like "I'm pissed,
but I'm gonna say that this is very
untasteful".


So I think it's quite key to know that
Hanratty was actually prosecuted
on very limited evidence, that wouldn't
pass in a judiciary system
in today's world. So the gun
that they found was completely wiped
clean
of dna and fingerprints, so there was no
link there to Hanratty at all. The
only link between the murder weapon
and Hanratty was the evidence of the
hotelier,
who said that Hanratty had stayed in
the room where they found the shell
casings,
but he'd also changed his story multiple
times which would make him an
incredible witness.
And then also the identity parade which,
as you mentioned, came down to the fact
of a verbal statement where she
correlated his accent to what she
remembered.
In today's society an identity parade
is not admissible in a court of law, you
can't use that as evidence.
But this was enough in the 1960s
to sentence a man to death. Yeah, just on
his accent.
Which is like, really good that they
don't have the
death sentence anymore. 



But also
his parents they had this extreme
incredulity, they just
didn't believe anything that the doctor
said,
the nun said, and then when he
got into his criminal career they were
like
"well he's not a psychopath"
because they just didn't believe it. His
dad
quit his job to start a window cleaning
business to keep him
out of his criminal life,
it feels like they just didn't believe
what society was telling them about
their own son.
He was diagnosed as a psychopath
twice before this happened and...
Separate institutions as well. It wasn't
the same person
diagnosing him either. No, I do
agree with you on the fact that he
shouldn't have
been put the death under the law
at the time, because they didn't have
enough evidence.


But also 40 years later they did say
that
like, the evidence on the handkerchief
and the
evidence on Valerie Story's knickers
was the same person. And it was
the only male dna profile
that they found? Yeah, so the DNA evidence
is quite interesting. So because the Hanratty estate
didn't let this drop, and they kept on
protesting, and they took it to the
court of appeal or some kind of
international court,
I don't know, and they had massive
following
john lennon and yoko ono
all joined in on this "Hanratty is
innocent,
let's get his name cleared
etc etc". Hanratty's mother
and brother actually provided the police
with DNA samples,
in the expectation that this would
aid his exoneration.
What they actually found was the DNA
of the mother and the brother showed
an incredibly strong familial link
with the DNA that was recovered at the
crime scene,
which is the DNA that was recovered from
the handkerchief
and from Valerie Story's knickers.
Now DNA evidence even back then,
so the case happened in the 50s and
elongated through the 60s, and
DNA profiling really come into
its prime in the 1980s
in the uk, so it wasn't until the 1980s
that this was possible to review. So
like twenty thirty years after the case
they were still
fighting to say no Hanratty is innocent.
The DNA that the mother and the brother
provided
was two and a half million times
more likely to come from James Hanratty
than it was from any other person. Now
that in itself
would usually be enough to
implicate a crime in modern day society,
but it was also enough for them to
exhume
Hanratty's body in 2001.
So the legal system takes an absolute
age
to act on anything, so
they recovered mucus on the handkerchief
and they recovered the semen from
the underwear of Valerie Story,
and they both proved an exact
match for Hanratty's exhumed
DNA, which is basically
guilty. There's almost no way
to refute this evidence, and yet they
still manage to find a way
to protest it and say this evidence
isn't reliable.
Yeah I think the solicitors
from the Hanratty family said that
the DNA evidence has to be
contamination from the fact that James
Hanratty's
stuff was in the same box
that they kept the knickers and the
handkerchief.
But also the scientists in 1997
or like 2000's said that there can be
cross
contamination because of the lax
transports blah blah blah.
But also there can't actually be
a question about who's guilty, seeing
as the only male DNA profile that they
found
on the handkerchief and on the
knickers was from a single male. They
couldn't find
any other male DNA. Yeah, their entire... So the defense solicitors
lawyers,
whatever you want to call them, apologies
for anyone in the legal profession.
Their argument against this DNA evidence was that they were
long held pieces of evidence,
and anyone with any scientific
background knows that DNA degrades over
time,
so these specimens weren't stored in
adequate storage conditions
to prolong the life of DNA. And also that
it was
all transported, like you said, in the
same box.
However in order to counter that, and the
solicitor said this themselves,
if you can eradicate the
issue of cross-contamination this
evidence
is condemning. And that was a statement
said by their defense lawyer, so this is
the lawyer hired
by the Hanratty's to clear Hanratty's
name, he said if you can clear the issue
of cross-contamination
we have no defense. The handkerchief
showed one set of DNA, and that DNA was
an
exact match for James Hanratty. The
underwear from Valerie Story
showed two sets of dna
one dna set was an exact match
for john hanratty the second set
of dna was from michael gregston so you
would
perfectly expect michael gregson's dna
to be on that underwear given that they
were in a relationship
she did say that they had sex before the
gunman came
but the scientists also said that
the dna the sea men on the underwear
weren't a match was to michael match to
john hanratty yeah
so yeah the way that dna analysis works
is so precise and so specific
to your reference sample that it's
almost it's almost impossible
to get a false positive result
the only way that you get a false
positive result
from modern day and modern day means
anything
from the 2000s onward when they
developed uh
pcr polymerase chain reaction
dna analysis is by identical twins
and as far as we're aware john hanratty
had no identical twin
um so there's no way that the dna match
that was found in the semen on the
underwear
could not have come from john hanratty
looking at the trial from now
i would say that he wouldn't have gotten
sentenced
because they didn't have enough evidence
but then in 2002 they did
i would say conclusively prove
that he was the perpetrator and when
people say that well
he was just a minor offense
kind of guy like he he wasn't like a
serial killer blah blah blah it is quite
interesting
that all of john hanratty's minor
offenses
were to do with vehicle crime
it does pose a question
as to if he was a regular carjacker
how he didn't know how to drive what the
americans call stick
shift or a manual car
that's miner would have been
yeah that's why people say that peter is
the offender
because he couldn't drive yeah he didn't
have
that carjacking experience but then
the dna evidence it's it's irrefutable
there's no there's no arguing yeah
but people still argue but i still feel
like
if james was the carjacker
that would have explained why he
thought they were insane well he thought
they weren't
watford when they weren't saint albans
yeah when they're innocent
yeah because he couldn't read the road
signs
yeah and if he wasn't local to the area
he wouldn't know where he was going
anyway if he didn't have that kind of
experience
with that kind of car or if he didn't
know where he was maybe he was also
stressed because he
shot just murdered someone yeah he saw
michael gregston in the head twice
point blank point blank range yeah yeah
i just want to say in conclusion
that valerie story became president of
her local women's
institute she helped organize transports
for disabled people in her community
and she lived the full life
after this james herrera was
executed which is not a thing that we do
now in britain should we say bye
uh are we done do you want to say
anything
else about that uh i've got some more
notes
on palomaris reaction but i don't really
want to go into it because i fucking
hate it
do you think there would be any chance
that he would be not guilty no
okay then that's fair enough
i think it's irrefutable that mr
hanratty was guilty
of murder attempted murder
rape uh vehicle abduction
that's not the legal term for whatever
it is when you hijack someone
hashtag not a lawyer um
i yeah from my point of view there is no
way that anybody could argue
that james hanratty is innocent
of the a6 murder not now
no i feel like we're lucky that he
was actually guilty
we're lucky that he was found guilty on
the circumstantial evidence
because on the scientific evidence that
was proven at late today
it was supported but it very much
comes down to the question of what kind
of
evidence should be admissible in court
and i think yeah we're very much in a
better place
now because there are very strict
regulations about what evidence
can be invisible and it's cases like
this
where you've got two prime suspects
that modern day policing
cannot accept eyewitness reports
and identity parades no i witnessed
reports and i don't separate
should definitely 100 percent be
not admissible because of
what we know about psychology today yeah
yeah and questions and
all of these kind of psychological bases
