  midweek murders contains graphic and
  explicit content,
  listener discretion is advised. I'm
  thinking that I might do
  like uh welcome to midweek murders
  and it's time to talk about crime like
  separately because saying welcome is so
  awkward. Do whatever you feel comfortable
  doing I will support you. Oh
  i wish you were my mom.
  Tune in next week for the reading of the
  dna test, will sandra find out who her
  real parents are,
  will joe disclose the mystery of how he
  gave
  birth to a child...
  play the jingle
  [Music]
  I took some more beer and now I just feel like eh this podcast
  it wasn't really a good idea was it?
  We'll just have a website and then it
  will be like an
  internet mystery forever, like the
  podcast that never was,
  like did anyone ever find them, are they the ones
  that got murdered?
  I should put up some of the like i've
  made a card for the episodes,
  so that we can fill it in later on
  podcast pending I should just put up
  hundreds of them and then someone
  somewhere will find it being like
  what, there's no like audio recordings
  did we not press record god damn it
  we've been doing this for years. The ultimate unresolved mystery.
  We'll be famous famous. But will I have to
  pretend to be dead?
  We'll be famous! Although if they start
  looking for like your internet presence
  being like is this a real person they
  will find...
  A mystery okay I have
  made notes and it looks like
  someone had a stroke in the middle of
  making notes.
  That's just your writing. Yeah I know
  and it's that bad.
  Okay this week we're gonna talk about
  the case of
  Sergei and Yulia Skripal.
  Skripal, like you should probably know
  how to pronounce their names
  when you're doing a podcast on them no
  offense sergei and yulia
  if you're out there. Skripal
  Oh yeah probably, and I got my research
  from bbc news,
  the guardian and the guardian article
  written by
  stephen morris and caroline bannock
  and also wikipedia. Wikipedia
  I think it started like with them
  finding sergei and yulia on a bench
  the fourth of march 2008
  17 18 18.
  Oh good well somebody did the research
  and it wasn't me!
  It's gonna be a long podcast man. Yeah I
  know right, and it won't be any material that we can
  use.
  Okay so i kind of figured from the
  articles
  that they figured out that they were
  poisoned
  quite quickly, right? They were found
  unconscious on the bench...
  Yeah but it could have been, you know,
  something else.
  I don't know what they were treated for
  immediately i would assume resuscitation.
  Yeah and then they like started barring
  off
  the house and stuff quite quickly didn't
  they?
  Yeah it's quite easy to tell if you've
  been
  poisoned in terms of blood work so I
  guess they found that out pretty quickly
  determined what it was and then decided
  that
  because it's quite easily spread,
  they needed to quarantine much like the
  situation we're in now.
  I burped while you were talking did you
  hear that? I did not hear that but
  i'm glad the listeners know. I tried to do it
  really
  quietly. So how long would you say like
  blood test comes back?
  Blood tests can be returned within the
  hour and given that they would have been
  sent to AE, yeah most hospitals have a
  60 minute
  turnaround time for blood tests
  so they would have found out pretty
  quickly. Okay
  so I looked at a timeline for the case
  and it was
  mr petrov and mr boshirov
  arrived in london on the 2nd of march
  so that's two days before. Obviously
  that's not their real names
  but that's what it said on their
  passports which, I find this quite
  weird, like how could they... Well I guess
  it's not that hard to fake a passport
  but i mean like,
  the the vile how did they
  ship the vial? Well the
  particular poison that they used was
  first discovered
  when they were looking for different
  types of pesticides
  so it's perfectly feasible that
  it was marketed to customs
  import, whoever would have looked at it
  if anyone looked at it
  as generic pesticide.
  But why would someone bring pesticide
  to another country? It's not really a
  question that customs ask. If it's not on
  their
  restricted list then it's not a problem.
  But it's also
  the same question as how do people get
  guns and knives on planes.
  I think that's a whole different topic
  of research.
  Okay i was also reading that
  yulia flied in from russia on the third
  and i was like what the fuck are the
  odds. She
  went to visit him didn't she? Yeah,
  she wasn't living with him.
  I feel like she's probably
  an innocent party in this, I think
  she wasn't the target. No i think that
  was accidental but also what are the odds
  that she flies in on the third,
  one day after the russian guys
  flew in, and one day before sergei
  and yulia was found poisoned. That's
  quite crazy.
  I think she's probably asking the same
  question yeah.
  Probably. Then I read that yulia and
  sergei
  kind of go to different parts of salisbury, salisbury,
  sorry I could say it before we recorded
  and then i was like
  wait wait can I say this?
  So they went to the pub which I feel is
  understandable. Understandable. Like you
  go to england of course the first stop
  is gonna be the pub, except for petrov
  and boshirov's
  alibi, they were like.. oh it was so funny
  I watched the video when they
  gave like a interview and I think that
  was for like a russian
  news outlet or something, I don't
  remember.
  But it was so funny they were like
  yeah our friends have been telling us
  for so long that you need to visit this
  wonderful town
  of salisbury, and
  and one of them is like yeah the
  cathedral
  isn't just known in europe it's also
  known around the world!
  Because it has this type of clock tower
  and this thing and blah blah blah and he just
  gives the exact numbers of like how tall it is and stuff
  like that, and I was like this is so
  beyond what a normal conversation would
  be like.
  Like first of all nobody recommends
  salisbury to another person. Um
  what if you want to go to stonehenge?
  well...
  I'll have you know is a world heritage
  site
  thank you very much! You're welcome
  salisbury listeners.
  [Laughter]
  It would have been more normal if they
  were like yeah
  we went to see stonehedge but they
  didn't say
  that now did they? Well they probably
  needed to cover their tracks as to why
  they were in and around
  the area where sergei and Yulia were
  found unconscious.
  Yeah they were spotted by cctv on like
  the street
  next to where he lived and the poison
  was sprayed on the door handle right?
  Yes. Yeah so administered dermally. Yeah they went to the pub
  and then they went to a restaurant, not
  the russian guys,
  uh Sergei and Yulia. And it's supposed to be
  so crazily poisonous this
  poison thing but
  they... as it seemed they walked around
  for a long time before they fell
  unconscious.
  Well I don't know, and I don't think this
  was it was ever established where the
  first
  point of contact with the poison was.
  I know they found it on his door handled
  to his house
  but that doesn't mean to say that there
  wasn't any that was also
  administered at the pub or
  in the restaurant. I think they kind of
  figured out that it must have been the
  door handle
  because that was the highest like
  concentration of it.
  Because in the pub they found like
  traces of it
  but the traces came from
  Sergei and and Yulia. I mean I can see why
  they would do it as a precautionary
  measure given that you need such a low
  dose
  to actually succumb to symptoms.
  Yeah I guess so and they must have
  sprayed such a
  tiny tiny amount if they were conscious
  for so many hours
  after having touched the doorknob right?
  The timeline between doorknob pub and
  restaurant,
  yeah I didn't write it up unfortunately,
  but
  it was like hours. They went to the
  cemetery because
  uh Sergei and's wife and his son
  was buried in the cemetery so they went
  to the cemetery to
  like visit their family their family's
  graves so it kind of felt
  like that was the last stop
  but they had spent hours at the
  restaurant
  particularly quite possibly
  i mean not a lot of toxicity data is
  available
  about the particular poison that was
  used because it is a banned substance
  um it's outlawed under multiple
  international laws so there's not going
  to be studies
  about the efficacy with respiration
  versus dermal contact I assume
  it's going to take longer to impact you
  through skin contact than it would
  aspirated straight into the lungs hmm
  yeah that makes sense but also not a
  doctor
  hashtag not a doctor
  so some history about Sergei and
  he was sentenced in 2006
  in russia for spying for the uk
  so he had been selling information about
  russian
  spies to mi6 for years
  i think they said like from the 1940s
  something and then he was a part of like
  what are you doing stirring my dinner
  are you cooking dinner yeah
  i've got to eat
  stop start that line again
  we'll edit that out colonel scribble he
  had
  been selling information about russian
  secret agents and stuff like that from
  the 1940s
  yeah so he was a double agent wasn't he
  so originally he was a spy for russia
  and then changed sides and started
  leaking
  war secrets to mi6 yeah that is
  why he was a target eventually
  from the russians yeah there was a
  website
  or investigative website called
  bellingcat that had tried to id
  the russians mr boshirov and
  petrov his name on the passport was like
  alexander petrov I think but that's
  obviously
  not what they were called also it's very
  funny in that interview I talked about
  the interviewer is like oh but what do
  you do
  like what do you work with and they were
  like oh we can't say that because then
  you're gonna like
  the people we work with are gonna be
  subject to harassment blah blah blah she
  was like but just tell us
  anything like why should we believe you
  what do you actually do for a living and
  they were like um
  let's just say we work in fitness
  which is like what perfectly rational
  area of work but also
  spoiler alert they don't work with
  fitness
  so bellingcat the investigative website
  that I mentioned had dug up
  an image of a colonel anatoly
  chefiga a natalie yes something along
  those lines
  and he obviously works for the russian
  government
  and the other guy is a doctor
  and he also works for the russian
  government surprise surprise
  and then also they had contact with
  another
  russian guy in england at the time
  that had contact with the russian
  government
  so it was starting to sound a bit
  suspicious it was the russian government
  obviously and funny thing
  is that I actually started like doing my
  research
  on reddit there was a lot about a lot of
  posts about
  trump saying to theresa may
  that I don't think the russians had
  anything to do with it
  well obviously everybody knows trump's
  an idiot
  like but I think to be fair politics at
  the time
  was probably not the most reliable
  source of information
  given that the uk foreign secretary
  was a certain boris johnson
  putin was asked to comment on the case
  and his response was something like you
  sought out the issues there
  then we'll talk which I feel like
  when you've been directly accused of
  murdering ex-soviet spies you might want
  to have a bit more of a firm
  comment we'll talk later um
  but the russian propaganda machine is so
  horribly successful in russia that
  they made like they made some research
  about
  what the russian population thinks about
  this
  and most people think that russia had
  nothing to do with it
  in russia but obviously they did
  well I didn't something like 36
  of people surveyed say that they'd never
  heard of the case before
  yeah that too which I mean it seems like
  an unbelievable statistic when just
  looking at it
  but then how remote are some
  areas in russia that they're gonna hear
  about an
  ex-soviet spy who was
  discreetly attempted to be killed yeah
  no I get it I just feel like i've seen
  like
  documentaries about how they
  use the news in russia and it's very
  effective like against their population
  and also how they use hackers
  lol and bots and stuff to destabilize
  every big democracy in the world
  it's crazy but getting back to the case
  sorry that was a tangent
  about conspiracies
  they did find traces of novichok
  the poison in the hotel room
  of these two guys as well so it's
  pretty clear that it was them it's
  pretty damning evidence
  and then they were fine found on the 4th
  of march right around about then yeah
  yeah and then
  i prepared a quiz how much did you pay
  attention to me
  and how much did you pay attention to
  making dinner
  i'm kidding 30 70.
  so the the 30th of june
  did I say that correctly that's a date
  yep
  that's a date all right we'll go with
  that dawn sturgess
  collapses in her
  flat no it was her friend's flat
  or her boyfriend's flat foaming at the
  mouth
  and at first the police said that they
  thought that it was
  drugs like heroin or something that was
  mixed with something else
  yeah and then it turns out it turns out
  that
  it's the same substance that
  Sergei and and Yulia was poisoned with and
  her friend or boyfriend differing
  reports on that
  charlie rowley also got sick
  and he said that he
  well this was also varying depending on
  which
  article I was reading but he said that
  he had found
  a perfume bottle that was sealed in its
  box in a charity bin three days prior
  and some friends of his or them
  said that he regularly scavenged like
  recycling bins for items to resell
  so I don't really know when he actually
  found the perfume but if he says that
  it's
  three days prior then probably I don't
  know
  like amesbury right dude
  yeah how far from salisbury is that no
  idea
  listeners comment below
  we don't have a comment section on on
  the website
  listeners tweet us
  if we ever go into twitter yeah sure at
  midweek murders
  and hashtag Sergei and and Yulia hashtag
  doctor let's not rope them into this
  there is innocent bystanders this
  podcast is going to be
  shit so dawn sturgess
  goes like into a coma or something she
  was on life support
  and in that guardian article that i
  referenced
  her they interviewed her mom and dad
  because she did die
  or she was taken off life support after
  a while and then
  they said that she was so contagious
  that they weren't allowed to touch her
  and she had been
  the mom had been stroking her hair and
  then she
  reached for her face to wipe a tear
  because she was crying
  and the doctors had been like don't
  touch your face
  and I was like what in the hell
  the thing is like she's lying in the
  hospital
  obviously they must have removed the
  clothes and like burned them or
  something because they
  must have been contagious but that she
  can still be
  that contagious or not contagious but
  like that
  poisonous is crazy to me
  well again it comes down to the
  difference between
  aspiration and dermal contact so if
  she's
  been exposed to the nerve agent
  through a perfume bottle that's
  immediately aspirating into the air so
  you've got
  a whole load more contamination points
  than you would by opening a contaminated
  door
  yeah they have to take considerations
  into that
  and given that it was confirmed as the
  same nerve agent
  it's it's like having an
  ebola outbreak you have to treat
  everything
  as highly contagious because you just
  don't
  know what's contaminated how easily it
  can pass on
  the the only like reference point I have
  to that
  is when I watched chernobyl
  the series and like obviously they were
  radioactive everyone all of the first
  responders the firefighters etc
  was so contaminated that their
  clothes are still contaminated today
  like well um madame curie who
  discovered uh radium her notebook
  is still contaminated and gives off a
  lethal dose of radiation
  it's stored in a lead box and can't be
  accessed by anyone
  without like proper radiation protection
  suits
  stuff like that can stick around for
  years and years and years
  and this particular nerve agent is
  really really difficult to get rid of
  you can't
  just wash it away if it gets into the
  water cycle then the water cycle is
  contaminated
  there's because so little is known about
  it the
  treatment and cleanup procedures have to
  be
  the highest order and the most severe
  just to make sure that you're reducing
  the risk of spread yeah her friend or
  boyfriend
  probably boyfriend charlie he said that
  he had
  probably contracted it while like
  putting
  while handling the bottle like that's
  why he was poisoned probably
  and she sprayed it on her wrist and
  that's
  why she died which is horrible but i
  feel like it's so
  crazy that like I don't know that
  everything
  gets so extremely contaminated by
  that little of like a poison
  well that's exactly the reason that
  chemical warfare
  is declared a war crime and that it's
  banned
  internationally yeah no I get it but it
  was very
  peculiar just like what's the chances
  how did that perfume perfume bottle
  end up in a recycling bin or in charity
  bin like
  that's crazy as well well it seems most
  likely
  that the guys that attempted the murder
  on Sergei and
  probably disposed of the evidence
  and the best way to dispose of evidence
  is to leave the scene of the crimes you
  go to
  a nearby town of don't take any advice
  listeners
  you go to a nearby town or village and
  get rid of evidence there
  if you've got no history in that town or
  village then police are less likely to
  suspect you
  to move to that place and it's easier to
  discard vital evidence
  yeah but it felt like why didn't they
  just throw it away
  because you spray a perfume bottle
  on someone's door handle and then go to
  the nearest bin
  that nearest bin is most likely going to
  be searched
  by the police in the coordinate limit
  but they could have like thrown it out
  in another bin why was it in the
  recycling bin
  i'm not a kgb agent I don't have
  the answers to this I just found it very
  strange
  that they just didn't permanently
  get rid of it I mean if you've not got
  the morals
  to be able to say no to murdering a
  former soviet spy
  you probably don't care how many more
  victims you also lay claim to
  yeah well that's true her parents
  dawn's parents described her as a gentle
  hippie I thought that was quite
  relatable because if somebody asked if i
  were to pass away and my
  somebody asked my parents like how would
  you describe sandra
  they would be like
  she was kind of gentle hippy
  what did she do with her life
  she had almost no I mean like they would
  be like she had all these
  liberal ideas you know she was one of
  those
  one of those commies
  yeah yeah so that's the case did you
  have
  more about the poison i've got loads
  more about the poison I was waiting for
  you to ask the questions about the
  poison
  tell me about the point
  so you mentioned earlier that
  uh it was called a novichok and these
  were a series of chemical
  weapons developed by the soviet union
  during the 1970s to the 1990s
  and during that time they were also
  outlawed so the purpose of developing
  them in the first place
  was for the cold war with the united
  states and
  wait what is that no i'm just kidding
  well the cold war
  so this particular agent that they used
  was called
  a234 and there's very little
  scientific data available about it
  how to make it obviously and any studies
  into their toxicity
  but there's certain comparisons to
  other nerve agents that have been
  studied
  more closely so there's another one
  called vx
  and I think it stands for venomous agent
  10.
  i'm assuming the x is roman numerals for
  ten
  clever boy yeah
  can't be can't be sure on that though um
  not a doctor
  anyway so the weapon a234
  has been deemed approximately five to
  eight
  times more toxic than vx
  and when you look at the toxicity data
  it's actually quite frightening to
  consider that
  so the ld50 which is
  the lethal dose required to kill 50
  of test participants is 7
  micrograms per kilogram
  if you translate that into what they
  usually
  extrapolate into which is a 70 kilogram
  adult male with no underlying health
  conditions
  the lethal dose of vx is
  0.49 milligrams
  oh shit that's so much
  so much less absolutely tiny amount
  yeah I imagine that
  a234 is five to eight times
  that lethal it's coming down to like
  two 0.2 milligrams
  via respiration to cause death which is
  why the medical staff
  and the police force and everybody
  involved in the case was so precautious
  about containing this case
  it's why don showed such severe symptoms
  and passed away whereas Sergei and and Yulia
  didn't
  was because a dose of 0.2 milligrams via
  respiration
  is a lethal dose that's like one or two
  spritzes
  inhaled of a perfume and that's enough
  that is crazy especially thinking like
  how much
  milligrams of painkillers you take
  or like yeah you think your standard
  dose of paracetamol is 500 milligrams
  and it takes 0.2 milligrams
  in order to kill an average male
  yeah I can't I i wanted to say that's
  like
  blah blah blah percent but let's not do
  maths um
  i can't
  [Laughter]
  but also um so it's a nerve agent which
  the nervous system controls your actions
  and your sensory information
  so every kind of movement every smell
  every site
  is all controlled by the nervous system
  and nerve agents all act the same way
  in that they inhibit the nervous
  response in the body
  and they do that by acting on what's
  called
  acetyl cholinesterase
  and the way that this works is in your
  synapses
  in the brain and in your body between
  muscles you create a compound called
  acetylcholine
  which is basically an instruction to
  either the muscle
  or the brain synapse to trigger and as
  soon as that
  information is passed and the synapse or
  the muscle has triggered
  the acetylcholine is broken down by the
  enzyme acetylcholinase
  now when you've inhaled or been exposed
  to a nerve agent
  it breaks down the acetylcholine
  esterase
  which means that your body is constantly
  firing
  instructions to either your muscles or
  your brain
  to do something so the most common
  effects of nerve agents is paralysis
  because your muscles are constantly
  being told to
  act so you go completely rigid you can't
  move
  that's why it's so painful yeah it's why
  don
  was found foaming at the mouth um
  because the
  salivary response in the mouth is also a
  nervous system response
  but it affects everything so it includes
  your heart
  it includes your diaphragm and all the
  muscles included for breathing
  which is why this was such a big issue
  for the police
  and the medical departments and why
  nerve agents have been outlawed across
  the world
  in terms of chemical warfare because
  they're completely harsh
  they're completely non-restrictive the
  only way to treat them
  is for doctors to identify via a blood
  test
  the acetylcholine levels and administer
  drugs that counteract the effect of the
  nerve agent
  and on the plus side those drugs
  themselves
  are toxic in high doses oh no
  so that's like my friend who's allergic
  to bees
  but she's also allergic to bee medicine
  like the medicine you take
  what is it called anaphylactics yeah
  oh it's been a it's been a tough ride
  you know
  yeah and the side effects get worse
  the longer you are exposed and untreated
  so it could start with eyes watering
  excessive mucus production in your nose
  foaming at the mouth localized paralysis
  but the more you are untreated the more
  this cholinesterase can build up in your
  synapses
  and it just continues until like all of
  the people Sergei and Yulia
  uh don her boyfriend charlie everybody
  was affected in the same way and it
  eventually leads to coma
  and unfortunately death
  i think maybe it wasn't that great that
  they thought that it was
  drugs at first well
  foaming at the mouth is also a very
  common side effect of a lot of
  overdose drugs so it's not particularly
  surprising that they thought that
  and I mean most often they'll do
  emergency blood tests anyway but
  actr or acth isn't
  often screened for it's a specific test
  request that you need to ask the lab to
  perform
  so you might not pick up on it on a
  normal routine blood test
  which obviously then impacts the
  patient's rate of survival
  yeah and also maybe like I feel bad for
  also the hospital workers like they must
  have been
  low-key poisoned as well yeah and
  that's why the measures were taken that
  the doctor told
  don's mum not to touch her hair
  or to and why the pub was shut down
  and the restaurant was shut down I think
  they
  replaced the roof of the house where
  Sergei and lived
  yeah I think I remember reading that the
  walls as well I think yeah
  but is that like nobody shocked like
  could that
  still be found in salisbury like
  on that bench or in that restaurant or
  like
  i would traces of it still be there
  everything would have been
  either decontaminated or decommissioned
  i know
  that with other nerve agents when a
  military response is called for
  quite often they'll call the bomb
  disposal unit and things like that
  um for other cases that have been
  documented in the uk
  they've actually buried the vehicles
  that were used to attend the response
  um so i'd imagine that's crazy
  yeah any kind of issue with
  contamination
  now will have been dealt with and
  everywhere would have been tested to a
  sufficient level to be able to say that
  it's safe yeah I think I read somewhere
  that
  one of the doctors that were in I think
  it was Sergei and's house
  uh he was in full half matsu and stuff
  but he still had to like get rid of
  all of his I think he got rid of all of
  his
  furniture they had to move it was crazy
  yeah it's a really really
  horrible weapon but that's
  why I think that I was so surprised that
  they were walking
  and spending time outside of the house
  for so long before
  actually having symptoms I don't know
  whether it was confirmed that it was the
  door knob
  i know that that was where the highest
  dose was found
  or the highest concentration but whether
  that was just
  a missed opportunity by the murderers
  because I don't think it was ever
  established where
  the initial point of contact was
  maybe not I thought it was the doorknob
  but
  maybe they weren't sure did I tell you
  before about one of the times when i
  called the police
  which time well there was one time when
  i was walking
  in south of sweden I think it was on my
  way home or something I don't remember
  and there was this girl or woman
  who was shouting obscenities
  more or less uh sitting on a stoop
  outside of a building
  and I could see that she was foaming
  from the mouth
  and I was like oh shit that can't be
  good
  so another girl walked up to her and
  tried to calm her down because she was
  very upset
  and I called the police that's the same
  number in sweden as like the
  hospital like the emergency vehicles
  in general so I called that number and i
  was like yeah there's a girl here she's
  foaming from the mouth I don't think
  that's good
  so they sent an ambulance I had never
  seen that
  before I think like it's a very
  crazy sight when someone's foaming at
  the mouth you immediately think
  something is very wrong here
  i immediately think rabies
  i'm sure I don't think it was rabies i
  think she was
  on drugs unfortunately well
  it could have been nerve agent a234 and
  you are just as prejudiced as the police
  officers that attended don
  i know right funny how that works
  uh well for the listeners out there just
  say no
  i'm not a police officer so
  [Laughter]
  nice save they would call and I would be
  like where
  salisbury that's not a place
  never heard of it oh you have a baby
  wonderful town with the fantastic
  cathedral that has this
  really old clock that you know it's
  spire reaches 233 and a half
  meters oh
  i would be like is it any
  where close to amesbury they were like
  yeah and I would be like ah
  doesn't make any sense I don't even know
  then why did you ask if it was close to
  amesbury
  i've got family there, I read it
  somewhere on the internet,
  I listened to a really bad
  podcast about it.
  Okay do you have your dinner ready now?
  It was already about 20 minutes ago. I'm
  so sorry, I'm gonna let
  you eat now. How are we gonna close this
  wonderful virginial podcast?
  This very, very professional podcast? Well,
  we could just say bye. Bye!

In this episode Sandra talks about 'bee medicine', Joe explains nerve agents, and the case discussed is the Salisbury poisonings, a.k.a the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, as well as the death of Dawn Sturgess. Sandra got her information from wikipedia, an article from The Guardian written by Steven Morris & Caroline Bannok, and that random interview with the Salisbury "tourists" on youtube. The image comparison between Mr Boshirov and Col Anatoliy Chepiga was first published by Bellingcat and [can be found here](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/26/skripal-suspect-boshirov-identified-gru-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga/). Joe got his information from wikipedia, which is also where we got the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Forensic_tent_at_The_Maltings,_Salisbury_(cropped).jpg) of the[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Forensic_tent_at_The_Maltings,_Salisbury_(cropped).jpg) forensic tent set up around the bench where Sergei and Yulia was found unconscious.

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content,
listener discretion is advised. I'm
thinking that I might do
like uh welcome to midweek murders
and it's time to talk about crime like
separately because saying welcome is so
awkward. Do whatever you feel comfortable
doing I will support you. Oh
i wish you were my mom.
Tune in next week for the reading of the

real parents are,
will joe disclose the mystery of how he

\[Music] 





I took some more beer and now I just feel like eh this podcast
it wasn't really a good idea was it?
We'll just have a website and then it
will be like an
internet mystery forever, like the
podcast that never was,
like did anyone ever find them, are they the ones
that got murdered?
I should put up some of the like i've
made a card for the episodes,
so that we can fill it in later on
podcast pending I should just put up
hundreds of them and then someone
somewhere will find it being like
what, there's no like audio recordings
did we not press record god damn it
we've been doing this for years. The ultimate unresolved mystery.
We'll be famous famous. But will I have to
pretend to be dead?
We'll be famous! Although if they start
looking for like your internet presence
being like is this a real person they
will find...
A mystery okay I have
made notes and it looks like
someone had a stroke in the middle of
making notes.
That's just your writing. Yeah I know
and it's that bad.




Okay this week we're gonna talk about
the case of
Sergei and Yulia Skripal.
Skripal, like you should probably know
how to pronounce their names
when you're doing a podcast on them no
offense sergei and Yulia
if you're out there. Skripal
Oh yeah probably, and I got my research
from bbc news,
the guardian and the guardian article
written by
stephen morris and caroline bannock
and also wikipedia. Wikipedia
I think it started like with them
finding sergei and yulia on a bench
the fourth of march 2008
17 18 18.
Oh good well somebody did the research
and it wasn't me!
It's gonna be a long podcast man. Yeah I
know right, and it won't be any material that we can
use.
Okay so i kind of figured from the
articles
that they figured out that they were
poisoned
quite quickly, right? They were found
unconscious on the bench...
Yeah but it could have been, you know,
something else.
I don't know what they were treated for
immediately i would assume resuscitation.
Yeah and then they like started barring
off
the house and stuff quite quickly didn't
they?
Yeah it's quite easy to tell if you've
been
poisoned in terms of blood work so I
guess they found that out pretty quickly
determined what it was and then decided
that
because it's quite easily spread,
they needed to quarantine much like the
situation we're in now.
I burped while you were talking did you
hear that? I did not hear that but
i'm glad the listeners know. I tried to do it
really
quietly. So how long would you say like
blood test comes back?
Blood tests can be returned within the
hour and given that they would have been
sent to AE, yeah most hospitals have a
60 minute
turnaround time for blood tests
so they would have found out pretty
quickly. Okay
so I looked at a timeline for the case
and it was
mr petrov and mr boshirov
arrived in london on the 2nd of march
so that's two days before. Obviously
that's not their real names
but that's what it said on their
passports which, I find this quite
weird, like how could they... Well I guess
it's not that hard to fake a passport
but i mean like,
the the vial how did they
ship the vial? Well the
particular poison that they used was
first discovered
when they were looking for different
types of pesticides
so it's perfectly feasible that
it was marketed to customs
import, whoever would have looked at it
if anyone looked at it
as generic pesticide.
But why would someone bring pesticide
to another country? It's not really a
question that customs ask. If it's not on
their
restricted list then it's not a problem.
But it's also
the same question as how do people get
guns and knives on planes.
I think that's a whole different topic
of research.




Okay I was also reading that
Yulia flied in from russia on the third
and I was like what the fuck are the
odds. She
went to visit him didn't she? Yeah,
she wasn't living with him.
I feel like she's probably
an innocent party in this, I think
she wasn't the target. No i think that
was accidental but also what are the odds
that she flies in on the third,
one day after the russian guys
flew in, and one day before sergei
and yulia was found poisoned. That's
quite crazy.
I think she's probably asking the same
question yeah.
Probably. Then I read that yulia and
sergei
kind of go to different parts of salisbury, salisbury,
sorry I could say it before we recorded
and then i was like
wait wait can I say this?
So they went to the pub which I feel is
understandable. Understandable. Like you
go to england of course the first stop
is gonna be the pub, except for petrov
and boshirov's
alibi, they were like.. oh it was so funny
I watched the video when they
gave like a interview and I think that
was for like a russian
news outlet or something, I don't
remember.
But it was so funny they were like
yeah our friends have been telling us
for so long that you need to visit this
wonderful town
of salisbury, and
and one of them is like yeah the
cathedral
isn't just known in europe it's also
known around the world!
Because it has this type of clock tower
and this thing and blah blah blah and he just
gives the exact numbers of like how tall it is and stuff
like that, and I was like this is so
beyond what a normal conversation would
be like.
Like first of all nobody recommends
salisbury to another person. Um
what if you want to go to stonehenge?
well...
I'll have you know is a world heritage
site
thank you very much! You're welcome
salisbury listeners.
\[Laughter] It would have been more normal if they
were like yeah
we went to see stonehedge but they
didn't say
that, now did they? Well they probably
needed to cover their tracks as to why
they were in and around
the area where sergei and Yulia were
found unconscious.
Yeah they were spotted by cctv on like
the street
next to where he lived and the poison
was sprayed on the door handle right?
Yes. Yeah so administered dermally. Yeah they went to the pub
and then they went to a restaurant, not
the russian guys,
uh Sergei and Yulia. And it's supposed to be
so crazily poisonous this
poison thing but
they... as it seemed they walked around
for a long time before they fell
unconscious.
Well I don't know, and I don't think this
was it was ever established where the
first
point of contact with the poison was.
I know they found it on his door handled
to his house
but that doesn't mean to say that there
wasn't any that was also
administered at the pub or
in the restaurant. I think they kind of
figured out that it must have been the
door handle
because that was the highest like
concentration of it.
Because in the pub they found like
traces of it
but the traces came from
Sergei and and Yulia. I mean I can see why
they would do it as a precautionary
measure given that you need such a low
dose
to actually succumb to symptoms.
Yeah I guess so and they must have
sprayed such a
tiny tiny amount if they were conscious
for so many hours
after having touched the doorknob right?
The timeline between doorknob pub and
restaurant,
yeah I didn't write it up unfortunately,
but
it was like hours. They went to the
cemetery because
uh Sergei's wife and his son
was buried in the cemetery so they went
to the cemetery to
like, visit their family, their family's
graves so it kind of felt
like that was the last stop.
But they had spent hours at the
restaurant
particularly. Quite possibly.
I mean not a lot of toxicity data is
available
about the particular poison that was
used because it is a banned substance, it's outlawed under multiple
international laws, so there's not going
to be studies
about the efficacy with respiration
versus dermal contact. I assume
it's going to take longer to impact you
through skin contact than it would
aspirated straight into the lungs. Hmm
yeah, that makes sense. But also not a
doctor.
Hashtag not a doctor.


So some history about Sergei.
He was sentenced in 2006
in russia for spying for the UK,
so he had been selling information about
russian
spies to MI6 for years.
I think they said like from the 1940s
something, and then he was a part of like...
What are you doing? Stirring my dinner.
Are you cooking dinner? Yeah,
I've got to eat.
Start that line again.
We'll edit that out. Colonel Skripal, he
had
been selling information about russian
secret agents and stuff like that from
the 1940s.
Yeah so he was a double agent, wasn't he?
So originally he was a spy for russia
and then changed sides and started
leaking
war secrets to MI6. Yeah that is
why he was a target, eventually
for the russians. Yeah there was a
website,
or investigative website, called
bellingcat that had tried to ID
the russians mr boshirov and
petrov, his name on the passport was like
alexander petrov I think, but that's
obviously
not what they were called. Also it's very
funny in that interview I talked about
the interviewer is like "oh but what do
you do,
like what do you work with" and they were
like "oh we can't say that because then
you're gonna like,
the people we work with are gonna be
subject to harassment" blah blah blah. She
was like but just tell us
anything, like why should we believe you?
What do you actually do for a living? And
they were like um
let's just say we work in fitness.
Which is like, what? Perfectly rational
area of work. But also,
spoiler alert, they don't work with
fitness.
So bellingcat the investigative website
that I mentioned had dug up
an image of a colonel anatoly
chefiga a natalie yes something along
those lines
and he obviously works for the russian
government
and the other guy is a doctor
and he also works for the russian
government surprise surprise
and then also they had contact with
another
russian guy in england at the time
that had contact with the russian
government
so it was starting to sound a bit
suspicious it was the russian government
obviously and funny thing
is that I actually started like doing my
research
on reddit there was a lot about a lot of
posts about
trump saying to theresa may
that I don't think the russians had
anything to do with it
well obviously everybody knows trump's
an idiot
like... But I think to be fair, politics at
the time
was probably not the most reliable
source of information
given that the uk foreign secretary
was a certain Boris Johnson.
Putin was asked to comment on the case
and his response was something like you
sought out the issues there
then we'll talk which I feel like
when you've been directly accused of
murdering ex-soviet spies you might want
to have a bit more of a firm
comment we'll talk later um
but the russian propaganda machine is so
horribly successful in russia that
they made like they made some research
about
what the russian population thinks about
this
and most people think that russia had
nothing to do with it
in russia but obviously they did
well I didn't something like 36
of people surveyed say that they'd never
heard of the case before
yeah that too which I mean it seems like
an unbelievable statistic when just
looking at it
but then how remote are some
areas in russia that they're gonna hear
about an
ex-soviet spy who was
discreetly attempted to be killed yeah
no I get it I just feel like i've seen
like
documentaries about how they
use the news in russia and it's very
effective like against their population
and also how they use hackers
lol and bots and stuff to destabilize
every big democracy in the world
it's crazy.





But getting back to the case
sorry that was a tangent
about conspiracies
they did find traces of novichok
the poison in the hotel room
of these two guys as well so it's
pretty clear that it was them it's
pretty damning evidence
and then they were fine found on the 4th
of march right around about then yeah
yeah and then
i prepared a quiz how much did you pay
attention to me,
and how much did you pay attention to
making dinner.
I'm kidding. 30/70.
so the the 30th of june
did I say that correctly that's a date
yep
that's a date all right we'll go with
that dawn sturgess
collapses in her
flat no it was her friend's flat
or her boyfriend's flat foaming at the
mouth
and at first the police said that they
thought that it was
drugs like heroin or something that was
mixed with something else
yeah and then it turns out it turns out
that
it's the same substance that
Sergei and and Yulia was poisoned with and
her friend or boyfriend differing
reports on that
charlie rowley also got sick
and he said that he
well this was also varying depending on
which
article I was reading but he said that
he had found
a perfume bottle that was sealed in its
box in a charity bin three days prior
and some friends of his or them
said that he regularly scavenged like
recycling bins for items to resell
so I don't really know when he actually
found the perfume but if he says that
it's
three days prior then probably I don't
know
like Amesbury right dude
yeah how far from Salisbury is that? No
idea.
Listeners comment below.
We don't have a comment section on on
the website.
Listeners tweet us.
If we ever go into twitter, yeah sure @midweekmurders
and hashtag Sergei and and Yulia, hashtag
not a doctor. Let's not rope them into this,
they're innocent bystanders. This
podcast is going to be
shit. So dawn sturgess
goes like into a coma or something she
was on life support
and in that guardian article that i
referenced
her they interviewed her mom and dad
because she did die
or she was taken off life support after
a while and then
they said that she was so contagious
that they weren't allowed to touch her
and she had been
the mom had been stroking her hair and
then she
reached for her face to wipe a tear
because she was crying
and the doctors had been like don't
touch your face
and I was like what in the hell
the thing is like she's lying in the
hospital
obviously they must have removed the
clothes and like burned them or
something because they
must have been contagious but that she
can still be
that contagious or not contagious but
like that
poisonous is crazy to me
well again it comes down to the
difference between
aspiration and dermal contact so if
she's
been exposed to the nerve agent
through a perfume bottle that's
immediately aspirating into the air so
you've got
a whole load more contamination points
than you would by opening a contaminated
door
yeah they have to take considerations
into that
and given that it was confirmed as the
same nerve agent
it's it's like having an
ebola outbreak you have to treat
everything
as highly contagious because you just
don't
know what's contaminated how easily it
can pass on
the the only like reference point I have
to that
is when I watched chernobyl
the series and like obviously they were
radioactive everyone all of the first
responders the firefighters etc
was so contaminated that their
clothes are still contaminated today
like well um madame curie who
discovered uh radium her notebook
is still contaminated and gives off a
lethal dose of radiation
it's stored in a lead box and can't be
accessed by anyone
without like proper radiation protection
suits
stuff like that can stick around for
years and years and years
and this particular nerve agent is
really really difficult to get rid of
you can't
just wash it away if it gets into the
water cycle then the water cycle is
contaminated
there's because so little is known about
it the
treatment and cleanup procedures have to
be
the highest order and the most severe
just to make sure that you're reducing
the risk of spread yeah her friend or
boyfriend
probably boyfriend charlie he said that
he had
probably contracted it while like
putting
while handling the bottle like that's
why he was poisoned probably
and she sprayed it on her wrist and
that's
why she died which is horrible but i
feel like it's so
crazy that like I don't know that
everything
gets so extremely contaminated by
that little of like a poison
well that's exactly the reason that
chemical warfare
is declared a war crime and that it's
banned
internationally yeah no I get it but it
was very
peculiar just like what's the chances
how did that perfume perfume bottle
end up in a recycling bin or in charity
bin like
that's crazy as well well it seems most
likely
that the guys that attempted the murder
on Sergei and
probably disposed of the evidence
and the best way to dispose of evidence
is to leave the scene of the crimes you
go to
a nearby town of don't take any advice
listeners
you go to a nearby town or village and
get rid of evidence there
if you've got no history in that town or
village then police are less likely to
suspect you
to move to that place and it's easier to
discard vital evidence
yeah but it felt like why didn't they
just throw it away
because you spray a perfume bottle
on someone's door handle and then go to
the nearest bin
that nearest bin is most likely going to
be searched
by the police in the coordinate limit
but they could have like thrown it out
in another bin why was it in the
recycling bin
i'm not a kgb agent I don't have
the answers to this I just found it very
strange
that they just didn't permanently
get rid of it I mean if you've not got
the morals
to be able to say no to murdering a
former soviet spy
you probably don't care how many more
victims you also lay claim to
yeah well that's true her parents
dawn's parents described her as a gentle
hippie I thought that was quite
relatable because if somebody asked if i
were to pass away and my
somebody asked my parents like how would
you describe sandra
they would be like
she was kind of gentle hippy
what did she do with her life
she had almost no I mean like they would
be like she had all these
liberal ideas you know she was one of
those
one of those commies.




Yeah, yeah, so that's the case. Did you
have
more about the poison? I've got loads
more about the poison, I was waiting for
you to ask the questions about the
poison.
Tell me about the poison.
So you mentioned earlier that it was called a novichok, and these
were a series of chemical
weapons developed by the soviet union
during the 1970s to the 1990s.
And during that time they were also
outlawed, so the purpose of developing
them in the first place
was for the cold war with the united
states and...
Wait, what is that? No, I'm just kidding.
Well the cold war...
So this particular agent that they used
was called
a234 and there's very little
scientific data available about it,
how to make it obviously, and any studies
into their toxicity.
But there's certain comparisons to
other nerve agents that have been
studied
more closely. So there's another one
called VX
and I think it stands for venomous agent 10. I'm assuming the x is roman numerals for ten.
Clever boy. Yeah,
can't be, can't be sure on that though.
Not a doctor.
Anyway, so the weapon A234
has been deemed approximately five to
eight
times more toxic than VX.
And when you look at the toxicity data
it's actually quite frightening to
consider that.
So the LD50, which is
the lethal dose required to kill 50 %
of test participants, is 7
micrograms per kilogram.
If you translate that into what they
usually
extrapolate into, which is a 70 kilogram
adult male with no underlying health
conditions,
the lethal dose of VX is
0.49 milligrams.
Oh shit, that's so much
so much less... Absolutely tiny amount.
Yeah, now imagine that
A234 is five to eight times
that lethal. It's coming down to like
two 0.2 milligrams
via respiration to cause death, which is
why the medical staff
and the police force, and everybody
involved in the case was so precautious
about containing this case.
It's why Dawn showed such severe symptoms
and passed away, whereas Sergei and and Yulia
didn't,
was because a dose of 0.2 milligrams via
respiration
is a lethal dose. That's like one or two
spritzes
inhaled of a perfume, and that's enough.
That is crazy, especially thinking like
how much
milligrams of painkillers you take,
or like... Yeah, you think your standard
dose of paracetamol is 500 milligrams,
and it takes 0.2 milligrams
in order to kill an average male.
Yeah I can't, I wanted to say that's
like,
blah blah blah percent but let's not do
maths.
I can't.
\[Laughter] But also, so it's a nerve agent which
the nervous system controls your actions
and your sensory information.
So every kind of movement, every smell,
every site,
is all controlled by the nervous system.
And nerve agents all act the same way
in that they inhibit the nervous
response in the body,
and they do that by acting on what's
called
acetyl cholinesterase.
And the way that this works is in your
synapses
in the brain and in your body between
muscles you create a compound called
acetylcholine
which is basically an instruction to
either the muscle
or the brain synapse to trigger and as
soon as that
information is passed and the synapse or
the muscle has triggered
the acetylcholine is broken down by the
enzyme acetylcholinase
now when you've inhaled or been exposed
to a nerve agent
it breaks down the acetylcholine
esterase
which means that your body is constantly
firing
instructions to either your muscles or
your brain
to do something so the most common
effects of nerve agents is paralysis
because your muscles are constantly
being told to
act so you go completely rigid you can't
move
that's why it's so painful yeah it's why
don
was found foaming at the mouth um
because the
salivary response in the mouth is also a
nervous system response
but it affects everything so it includes
your heart
it includes your diaphragm and all the
muscles included for breathing
which is why this was such a big issue
for the police
and the medical departments and why
nerve agents have been outlawed across
the world
in terms of chemical warfare because
they're completely harsh
they're completely non-restrictive the
only way to treat them
is for doctors to identify via a blood
test
the acetylcholine levels and administer
drugs that counteract the effect of the
nerve agent
and on the plus side those drugs
themselves
are toxic in high doses oh no
so that's like my friend who's allergic
to bees
but she's also allergic to bee medicine
like the medicine you take
what is it called anaphylactics yeah
oh it's been a it's been a tough ride
you know
yeah and the side effects get worse
the longer you are exposed and untreated
so it could start with eyes watering
excessive mucus production in your nose
foaming at the mouth localized paralysis
but the more you are untreated the more
this cholinesterase can build up in your
synapses
and it just continues until like all of
the people Sergei and Yulia
uh don her boyfriend charlie everybody
was affected in the same way and it
eventually leads to coma
and unfortunately death
i think maybe it wasn't that great that
they thought that it was
drugs at first well
foaming at the mouth is also a very
common side effect of a lot of
overdose drugs so it's not particularly
surprising that they thought that
and I mean most often they'll do
emergency blood tests anyway but
actr or acth isn't
often screened for it's a specific test
request that you need to ask the lab to
perform
so you might not pick up on it on a
normal routine blood test
which obviously then impacts the
patient's rate of survival
yeah and also maybe like I feel bad for
also the hospital workers like they must
have been
low-key poisoned as well yeah and
that's why the measures were taken that
the doctor told
don's mum not to touch her hair
or to and why the pub was shut down
and the restaurant was shut down I think
they
replaced the roof of the house where
Sergei and lived
yeah I think I remember reading that the
walls as well I think yeah
but is that like nobody shocked like
could that
still be found in salisbury like
on that bench or in that restaurant or
like
i would traces of it still be there
everything would have been
either decontaminated or decommissioned
i know
that with other nerve agents when a
military response is called for
quite often they'll call the bomb
disposal unit and things like that
um for other cases that have been
documented in the uk
they've actually buried the vehicles
that were used to attend the response
um so i'd imagine that's crazy
yeah any kind of issue with
contamination
now will have been dealt with and
everywhere would have been tested to a
sufficient level to be able to say that
it's safe yeah I think I read somewhere
that
one of the doctors that were in I think
it was Sergei and's house
uh he was in full half matsu and stuff
but he still had to like get rid of
all of his I think he got rid of all of
his
furniture they had to move it was crazy
yeah it's a really really
horrible weapon but that's
why I think that I was so surprised that
they were walking
and spending time outside of the house
for so long before
actually having symptoms I don't know
whether it was confirmed that it was the
door knob
i know that that was where the highest
dose was found
or the highest concentration but whether
that was just
a missed opportunity by the murderers
because I don't think it was ever
established where
the initial point of contact was
maybe not I thought it was the doorknob
but
maybe they weren't sure. 



Did I tell you
before about one of the times when I
called the police?
Which time? Well there was one time when
I was walking
in the south of sweden, I think it was on my
way home or something I don't remember
and there was this girl or woman
who was shouting obscenities
more or less uh sitting on a stoop
outside of a building
and I could see that she was foaming
from the mouth
and I was like oh shit that can't be
good
so another girl walked up to her and
tried to calm her down because she was
very upset
and I called the police that's the same
number in sweden as like the
hospital like the emergency vehicles
in general so I called that number and i
was like yeah there's a girl here she's
foaming from the mouth I don't think
that's good
so they sent an ambulance I had never
seen that
before I think like it's a very
crazy sight when someone's foaming at
the mouth you immediately think
something is very wrong here
i immediately think rabies
i'm sure I don't think it was rabies i
think she was
on drugs unfortunately well
it could have been nerve agent a234 and
you are just as prejudiced as the police
officers that attended don
i know right funny how that works
uh well for the listeners out there just
say no
i'm not a police officer so
\[Laughter] nice save they would call and I would be
like where
salisbury that's not a place
never heard of it oh you have a baby
wonderful town with the fantastic
cathedral that has this
really old clock that you know it's
spire reaches 233 and a half
meters oh
i would be like is it any
where close to amesbury they were like
yeah and I would be like ah
doesn't make any sense I don't even know
then why did you ask if it was close to
amesbury
i've got family there I read it
somewhere on the internet,
that's a place. I listened to a really bad
podcast about it.
Okay, do you have your dinner ready now?
It was already about 20 minutes ago. I'm
so sorry, I'm gonna let
you eat now. How are we gonna close this
wonderful virginial podcast?
