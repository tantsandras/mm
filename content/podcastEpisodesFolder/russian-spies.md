In this episode Sandra talks about 'bee medicine', Joe explains nerve agents, and the case discussed is the Salisbury poisonings, a.k.a the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, as well as the death of Dawn Sturgess. Sandra got her information from wikipedia, an article from The Guardian written by Steven Morris & Caroline Bannok, and that random interview with the Salisbury "tourists" on youtube. The image comparison between Mr Boshirov and Col Anatoliy Chepiga was first published by Bellingcat and [can be found here](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/26/skripal-suspect-boshirov-identified-gru-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga/). Joe got his information from wikipedia, which is also where we got the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Forensic_tent_at_The_Maltings,_Salisbury_(cropped).jpg) of the[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Forensic_tent_at_The_Maltings,_Salisbury_(cropped).jpg) forensic tent set up around the bench where Sergei and Yulia was found unconscious.
