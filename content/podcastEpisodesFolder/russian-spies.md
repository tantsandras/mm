descriptionText: In this episode Sandra talks about 'bee medicine', Joe explains
  nerve agents, and the case discussed is the Salisbury poisonings, a.k.a the
  attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, as well as the death of Dawn
  Sturgess. Sandra got her information from wikipedia, an article from The
  Guardian written by Steven Morris & Caroline Bannok, and that random interview
  with the Salisbury "tourists" on youtube. The image comparison between Mr
  Boshirov and Col Anatoliy Chepiga was first published by Bellingcat at
  (https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/26/skripal-suspect-boshirov-identified-gru-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga/).
  Joe got his information from wikipedia, that is also where we got the image of
  the forensic tent set up around the bench where Sergei and Yulia was found
  unconscious
