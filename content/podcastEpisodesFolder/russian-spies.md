In this episode Sandra talks about 'bee medicine', Joe explains nerve agents, and the case discussed is the Salisbury poisonings, a.k.a the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, as well as the death of Dawn Sturgess. Sandra got her information from wikipedia, an article from The Guardian written by Steven Morris & Caroline Bannok, and that random interview with the Salisbury "tourists" on youtube. The image comparison between Mr Boshirov and Col Anatoliy Chepiga was first published by Bellingcat and [can be found here](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/26/skripal-suspect-boshirov-identified-gru-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga/). Joe got his information from wikipedia, which is also where we got the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Forensic_tent_at_The_Maltings,_Salisbury_(cropped).jpg) of the[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Forensic_tent_at_The_Maltings,_Salisbury_(cropped).jpg) forensic tent set up around the bench where Sergei and Yulia was found unconscious.

#### Audio transcript

Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised. 

I'm
thinking that I might do
like: "welcome to midweek murders,
and it's time to talk about crime", like
separately. Because saying welcome is so
awkward. 

Do whatever you feel comfortable
doing I will support you. 


I wish you were my mom.


Tune in next week for the reading of the
DNA test, will Sandra find out who her
real parents are,
will Joe disclose the mystery of how he
gave
birth to a child...
play the jingle
\[Music] 

I took some more beer and now I just feel like eh this podcast it wasn't really a good idea was it?
We'll just have a website and then it
will be like an
internet mystery forever, like the
podcast that never was,
like did anyone ever find them, are they the ones
that got murdered?
I should put up some of the like i've
made a card for the episodes,
so that we can fill it in later on.


Podcast pending.

I should just put up
hundreds of them and then someone
somewhere will find it being like
what, there's no like audio recordings
did we not press record god damn it
we've been doing this for years. The ultimate unresolved mystery.


We'll be famous famous. But will I have to
pretend to be dead?


We'll be famous! Although if they start
looking for like your internet presence
being like is this a real person they
will find...
A mystery.

Okay I have
made notes, and it looks like
someone had a stroke in the middle of
making notes.


That's just your writing. 

Yeah I know,
and it's that bad.

Okay this week we're gonna talk about the case of
Sergei and Yulia Skripal.
Skripal...

You should probably know
how to pronounce their names
when you're doing a podcast on them, no
offense Sergei and Yulia
if you're out there. Skripal.


Oh yeah probably, and I got my research
from bbc news,
the guardian and the guardian article
written by
stephen morris and caroline bannock
and also wikipedia. Wikipedia
I think it started like with them
finding Sergei and Yulia on a bench
the fourth of March 2000 and 17. 18. 18.


Oh good well somebody did the research
and it wasn't me!


It's gonna be a long podcast man. 

Yeah I
know right, and it won't be any material that we can
use.
Okay so i kind of figured from the
articles
that they figured out that they were
poisoned
quite quickly, right? They were found
unconscious on the bench...
Yeah but it could have been, you know,
something else.


I don't know what they were treated for
immediately i would assume resuscitation.


Yeah and then they like started barring
off
the house and stuff quite quickly didn't
they?


Yeah it's quite easy to tell if you've
been
poisoned in terms of blood work, so I
guess they found that out pretty quickly.
Determined what it was and then decided
that
because it's quite easily spread,
they needed to quarantine much like the
situation we're in now.


I burped while you were talking did you
hear that? 

I did not hear that but
I'm glad the listeners know. 

I tried to do it
really
quietly. So how long would you say like
blood test comes back?


Blood tests can be returned within the
hour and given that they would have been
sent to AE, yeah most hospitals have a
60 minute
turnaround time for blood tests
so they would have found out pretty
quickly. Okay
so I looked at a timeline for the case
and it was
Mr Petrov and Mr Boshirov
arrived in london on the 2nd of March
so that's two days before. Obviously
that's not their real names
but that's what it said on their
passports which, I find this quite
weird, like how could they... Well I guess
it's not that hard to fake a passport
but i mean like,
the the vial how did they
ship the vial? 

Well the
particular poison that they used was
first discovered
when they were looking for different
types of pesticides,
so it's perfectly feasible that
it was marketed to customs
import, whoever would have looked at it,
if anyone looked at it,
as generic pesticide.


But why would someone bring pesticide
to another country? 

It's not really a
question that customs ask. If it's not on
their
restricted list then it's not a problem.
But it's also
the same question as how do people get
guns and knives on planes.
I think that's a whole different topic
of research.

Okay I was also reading that Yulia flied in from russia on the third
and I was like what the fuck are the
odds. She
went to visit him didn't she? Yeah,
she wasn't living with him.
I feel like she's probably
an innocent party in this, I think
she wasn't the target. No i think that
was accidental but also what are the odds
that she flies in on the third,
one day after the russian guys
flew in, and one day before Sergei
and Yulia was found poisoned. That's
quite crazy.


I think she's probably asking the same
question yeah.


Probably. Then I read that Yulia and
Sergei
kind of go to different parts of Salisbury, Salisbury.
Sorry, I could say it before we recorded
and then i was like:
"wait, wait can I say this?".
So they went to the pub which I feel is
understandable. 

Understandable. 

Like you
go to england of course the first stop
is gonna be the pub, except for Petrov
and Boshirov's
alibi, they were like.. oh it was so funny
I watched the video when they
gave like a interview and I think that
was for like a russian
news outlet or something, I don't
remember.
But it was so funny they were like
yeah our friends have been telling us
for so long that you need to visit this
wonderful town
of salisbury, and
and one of them is like yeah the
cathedral
isn't just known in europe it's also
known around the world!
Because it has this type of clock tower
and this thing and blah blah blah and he just
gives the exact numbers of like how tall it is and stuff
like that, and I was like this is so
beyond what a normal conversation would
be like.
Like first of all nobody recommends
salisbury to another person. 

Um what if you want to go to Stonehenge?


Well...


I'll have you know is a world heritage site, thank you very much! You're welcome
salisbury listeners.
\[Laughter] 

It would have been more normal if they were like yeah
we went to see Stonehedge but they
didn't say
that, now did they? 

Well they probably
needed to cover their tracks as to why
they were in and around
the area where sergei and Yulia were
found unconscious.


Yeah they were spotted by cctv on like
the street
next to where he lived and the poison
was sprayed on the door handle right?
Yes. Yeah so administered dermally. Yeah they went to the pub
and then they went to a restaurant, not
the russian guys,
uh Sergei and Yulia. And it's supposed to be
so crazily poisonous this
poison thing but
they... as it seemed they walked around
for a long time before they fell
unconscious.
Well I don't know, and I don't think this
was it was ever established where the
first
point of contact with the poison was.
I know they found it on his door handled
to his house
but that doesn't mean to say that there
wasn't any that was also
administered at the pub or
in the restaurant. I think they kind of
figured out that it must have been the
door handle
because that was the highest like
concentration of it.
Because in the pub they found like
traces of it
but the traces came from
Sergei and and Yulia. 

I mean I can see why
they would do it as a precautionary
measure given that you need such a low
dose
to actually succumb to symptoms.


Yeah I guess so, and they must have
sprayed such a
tiny tiny amount if they were conscious
for so many hours
after having touched the doorknob right?
The timeline between doorknob pub and
restaurant,
yeah I didn't write it up unfortunately,
but
it was like hours. They went to the
cemetery because
uh Sergei's wife and his son
was buried in the cemetery so they went
to the cemetery to
like, visit their family, their family's
graves so it kind of felt
like that was the last stop.
But they had spent hours at the
restaurant
particularly. Quite possibly.
I mean not a lot of toxicity data is
available
about the particular poison that was
used because it is a banned substance, it's outlawed under multiple
international laws, so there's not going
to be studies
about the efficacy with respiration
versus dermal contact. I assume
it's going to take longer to impact you
through skin contact than it would
aspirated straight into the lungs. Hmm
yeah, that makes sense. But also not a
doctor.
Hashtag not a doctor.

So some history about Sergei. He was sentenced in 2006
in russia for spying for the UK,
so he had been selling information about
russian
spies to MI6 for years.
I think they said like from the 1940s
something, and then he was a part of like...
What are you doing? 

Stirring my dinner.


Are you cooking dinner? 

Yeah,
I've got to eat.
Start that line again.
We'll edit that out. 

Colonel Skripal, he
had
been selling information about russian
secret agents and stuff like that from
the 1940s.
Yeah so he was a double agent, wasn't he?
So originally he was a spy for russia
and then changed sides and started
leaking
war secrets to MI6. Yeah that is
why he was a target, eventually
for the russians. Yeah there was a
website,
or investigative website, called
bellingcat that had tried to ID
the russians mr boshirov and
petrov, his name on the passport was like
alexander petrov I think, but that's
obviously
not what they were called. Also it's very
funny in that interview I talked about
the interviewer is like "oh but what do
you do,
like what do you work with" and they were
like "oh we can't say that because then
you're gonna like,
the people we work with are gonna be
subject to harassment" blah blah blah. She
was like but just tell us
anything, like why should we believe you?
What do you actually do for a living? And
they were like um
let's just say we work in fitness.
Which is like, what? Perfectly rational
area of work. But also,
spoiler alert, they don't work with
fitness.
So bellingcat the investigative website
that I mentioned had dug up
an image of a colonel anatoly
chefiga a natalie yes something along
those lines
and he obviously works for the russian
government
and the other guy is a doctor
and he also works for the russian
government surprise surprise
and then also they had contact with
another
russian guy in england at the time
that had contact with the russian
government
so it was starting to sound a bit
suspicious it was the russian government
obviously and funny thing
is that I actually started like doing my
research
on reddit there was a lot about a lot of
posts about
trump saying to theresa may
that I don't think the russians had
anything to do with it
well obviously everybody knows trump's
an idiot
like... 

But I think to be fair, politics at
the time
was probably not the most reliable
source of information
given that the uk foreign secretary
was a certain Boris Johnson.
Putin was asked to comment on the case
and his response was something like you
sought out the issues there
then we'll talk. Which I feel like,
when you've been directly accused of
murdering ex-soviet spies you might want
to have a bit more of a firm
comment than "we'll talk later" 

But the russian propaganda machine is so
horribly successful in russia that
they made like, they made some research
about
what the russian population thinks about
this,
and most people think that russia had
nothing to do with it.
In russia. But obviously they did.


Well, didn't something like 36%
of people surveyed say that they'd never
heard of the case before?


Yeah that too. 

Which, I mean, it seems like
an unbelievable statistic when just
looking at it.
But then how remote are some
areas in russia, that they're gonna hear
about an
ex-soviet spy who was
discreetly attempted to be killed? 

Yeah,
no, I get it. I just feel like i've seen
like
documentaries about how they
use the news in russia. And it's very
effective, like against their population.
And also how they use hackers
lol, and bots and stuff, to destabilize
every big democracy in the world.
It's crazy.

But getting back to the case sorry that was a tangent
about conspiracies.
They did find traces of novichok,
the poison, in the hotel room
of these two guys as well. So it's
pretty clear that it was them. 

It's
pretty damning evidence.


And then they were fine found on the 4th
of march, right? 

Around about then, yeah.


Yeah and then
I've prepared a quiz. How much did you pay
attention to me,
and how much did you pay attention to
making dinner?
I'm kidding. 

30/70.


So the the 30th of June,
did I say that correctly? That's a date.
Yep.
That's a date, all right, we'll go with
that. Dawn Sturgess
collapses in her
flat. No, it was her friend's flat,
or her boyfriend's flat, foaming at the
mouth.
And at first the police said that they
thought that it was
drugs, like heroin or something, that was
mixed with something else.
Yeah, and then it turns out
that
it's the same substance that
Sergei and and Yulia was poisoned with. And
her friend, or boyfriend, differing
reports on that,
Charlie Rowley also got sick.
And he said that he...
Well, this was also varying, depending on
which
article I was reading, but he said that
he had found
a perfume bottle that was sealed in its
box in a charity bin three days prior.
And some friends of his, or them,
said that he regularly scavenged
recycling bins for items to resell.
So I don't really know when he actually
found the perfume but if he says that
it's
three days prior, then probably. I don't
know.
In Amesbury.
Yeah how far from Salisbury is that? 

No idea. Listeners comment below.


We don't have a comment section on on the website.


Listeners tweet us.


If we ever go into twitter, yeah sure @midweekmurders


And hashtag Sergei and and Yulia, hashtag not a doctor. 

Let's not rope them into this, they're innocent bystanders. This
podcast is going to be shit. 

So Dawn Sturgess goes like into a coma or something, she
was on life support.
And in that guardian article that I
referenced, they interviewed her mom and dad
because she did die,
or she was taken off life support after
a while. And then
they said that she was so contagious
that they weren't allowed to touch her.
And she had been,
the mom had been stroking her hair and
then she
reached for her face to wipe a tear
because she was crying,
and the doctors had been like don't
touch your face.
And I was like "what in the hell?".
The thing is like, she's lying in the
hospital,
obviously they must have removed the
clothes and like burned them or
something because they
must have been contagious, but that she
can still be
that contagious, or not contagious but
like that
poisonous, is crazy to me.


Well again it comes down to the
difference between
aspiration and dermal contact. So if
she's
been exposed to the nerve agent
through a perfume bottle, that's
immediately aspirating into the air so
you've got
a whole load more contamination points
than you would by opening a contaminated
door.


Yeah. 

They have to take considerations
into that.
And given that it was confirmed as the
same nerve agent...
It's like having an
ebola outbreak, you have to treat
everything
as highly contagious because you just
don't
know what's contaminated, how easily it
can pass on.


The only like reference point I have
to that
is when I watched chernobyl
the series, and like obviously they were
radioactive. Everyone, all of the first
responders, the firefighters etc,
was so contaminated that their
clothes are still contaminated today.


Like Madame Curie who
discovered radium, her notebook
is still contaminated and gives off a
lethal dose of radiation.
It's stored in a lead box and can't be
accessed by anyone
without like proper radiation protection
suits.
Stuff like that can stick around for
years and years and years.
And this particular nerve agent is
really really difficult to get rid of.
You can't
just wash it away. If it gets into the
water cycle then the water cycle is
contaminated.
There's... Because so little is known about
it, the
treatment and cleanup procedures have to
be
the highest order and the most severe
just to make sure that you're reducing
the risk of spread.

Yeah her friend or
boyfriend,
probably boyfriend, Charlie he said that
he had
probably contracted it while like
putting,
while handling the bottle. That's
why he was poisoned, probably.
And she sprayed it on her wrist and
that's
why she died. Which is horrible, but I
feel like it's so
crazy that like... I don't know that
everything
gets so extremely contaminated by
that little of a poison.


Well that's exactly the reason that
chemical warfare
is declared a war crime, and that it's
banned
internationally. 

Yeah no, I get it, but it
was very
peculiar. Just like what're the chances?
How did that perfume perfume bottle
end up in a recycling bin, or in charity
bin, like
that's crazy. 

Well it seems most
likely
that the guys that attempted the murder
on Sergei
probably disposed of the evidence.
And the best way to dispose of evidence
is to leave the scene of the crime. You
go to
a nearby town... Don't take any advice
listeners!
You go to a nearby town or village and
get rid of evidence there.
If you've got no history in that town or
village then police are less likely to
suspect you
to move to that place, and it's easier to
discard vital evidence.


Yeah but it felt like, why didn't they
just throw it away?


Because you spray a perfume bottle
on someone's door handle and then go to
the nearest bin,
that nearest bin is most likely going to
be searched
by the police in the coordinate limit.


But they could have like thrown it out
in another bin. Why was it in the
recycling bin?


I'm not a KGB agent, I don't have
the answers to this. 

I just found it very
strange
that they just didn't permanently
get rid of it. 

I mean if you've not got
the morals
to be able to say no to murdering a
former soviet spy,
you probably don't care how many more
victims you also lay claim to.


Yeah well that's true. Her parents,
Dawn's parents, described her as a gentle
hippie. I thought that was quite
relatable because if somebody asked... if I
were to pass away and somebody asked my parents like: "how would
you describe Sandra",
they would be like:
"she was kind of gentle hippy",
"What did she do with her life?".
I mean like, they would
be like: "she had all these
liberal ideas, you know she was one of
those"...


One of those commies.

Yeah, yeah, so that's the case. Did you have
more about the poison? 

I've got loads
more about the poison, I was waiting for
you to ask the questions about the
poison.


Tell me about the poison.


So you mentioned earlier that it was called a novichok, and these
were a series of chemical
weapons developed by the soviet union
during the 1970s to the 1990s.
And during that time they were also
outlawed, so the purpose of developing
them in the first place
was for the cold war with the united
states and...


Wait, what is that? No, I'm just kidding.


Well the cold war...


So this particular agent that they used
was called
A234 and there's very little
scientific data available about it,
how to make it obviously, and any studies
into their toxicity.
But there's certain comparisons to
other nerve agents that have been
studied
more closely. So there's another one
called VX
and I think it stands for venomous agent 10. I'm assuming the x is roman numerals for ten.
Clever boy. Yeah,
can't be, can't be sure on that though.
Not a doctor.
Anyway, so the weapon A234
has been deemed approximately five to
eight
times more toxic than VX.
And when you look at the toxicity data
it's actually quite frightening to
consider that.
So the LD50, which is
the lethal dose required to kill 50 %
of test participants, is 7
micrograms per kilogram.
If you translate that into what they
usually
extrapolate into, which is a 70 kilogram
adult male with no underlying health
conditions,
the lethal dose of VX is
0.49 milligrams.


Oh shit, that's so much,
so much less... 

Absolutely tiny amount.
Yeah, now imagine that
A234 is five to eight times
that lethal. It's coming down to like
two 0.2 milligrams
via respiration to cause death, which is
why the medical staff
and the police force, and everybody
involved in the case was so precautious
about containing this case.
It's why Dawn showed such severe symptoms
and passed away, whereas Sergei and and Yulia
didn't,
was because a dose of 0.2 milligrams via
respiration
is a lethal dose. That's like one or two
spritzes
inhaled of a perfume, and that's enough.


That is crazy, especially thinking like
how much
milligrams of painkillers you take,
or like... 

Yeah, you think your standard
dose of paracetamol is 500 milligrams,
and it takes 0.2 milligrams
in order to kill an average male.


Yeah I can't, I wanted to say that's
like,
blah blah blah percent but let's not do
maths.
I can't.
\[Laughter] 

But also, so it's a nerve agent which the nervous system controls your actions
and your sensory information.
So every kind of movement, every smell,
every site,
is all controlled by the nervous system.
And nerve agents all act the same way
in that they inhibit the nervous
response in the body,
and they do that by acting on what's
called
acetyl cholinesterase.
And the way that this works is in your
synapses
in the brain and in your body between
muscles, you create a compound called
acetylcholine,
which is basically an instruction to
either the muscle
or the brain synapse to trigger and as
soon as that
information is passed and the synapse or
the muscle has triggered
the acetylcholine is broken down by the
enzyme acetylcholinase.
Now when you've inhaled or been exposed
to a nerve agent,
it breaks down the acetylcholine
esterase,
which means that your body is constantly
firing
instructions to either your muscles or
your brain
to do something. So the most common
effects of nerve agents is paralysis,
because your muscles are constantly
being told to
act. So you go completely rigid, you can't
move.
That's why it's so painful. Yeah it's why
Dawn
was found foaming at the mouth,
because the
salivary response in the mouth is also a
nervous system response.
But it affects everything so it includes
your heart,
it includes your diaphragm, and all the
muscles included for breathing.
Which is why this was such a big issue
for the police
and the medical departments, and why
nerve agents have been outlawed across
the world
in terms of chemical warfare. Because
they're completely harsh,
they're completely non-restrictive. The
only way to treat them
is for doctors to identify via a blood
test
the acetylcholine levels and administer
drugs that counteract the effect of the
nerve agent.
And on the plus side those drugs
themselves
are toxic in high doses. 

Oh no.
So that's like my friend who's allergic
to bees,
but she's also allergic to bee medicine.
Like the medicine you take...
What is it called? 

Anaphylactics. 

Yeah. Oh it's been a it's been a tough ride,
you know.


Yeah and the side effects get worse
the longer you are exposed and untreated.
So it could start with eyes watering,
excessive mucus production in your nose,
foaming at the mouth, localized paralysis,
but the more you are untreated the more
this cholinesterase can build up in your
synapses.
And it just continues until like all of
the people, Sergei and Yulia,
Dawn, her boyfriend Charlie, everybody
was affected in the same way and it
eventually leads to coma
and unfortunately death.


I think maybe it wasn't that great that
they thought that it was
drugs at first.

Well
foaming at the mouth is also a very
common side effect of a lot of
overdose drugs, so it's not particularly
surprising that they thought that.
And I mean most often they'll do
emergency blood tests anyway, but
ACTR or acth isn't
often screened for, it's a specific test
request that you need to ask the lab to
perform.
So you might not pick up on it on a
normal routine blood test,
which obviously then impacts the
patient's rate of survival.


Yeah and also, maybe like, I feel bad for
also the hospital workers like they must
have been
low-key poisoned as well. 

Yeah and
that's why the measures were taken that
the doctor told
Dawn's mum not to touch her hair, and why the pub was shut down,
and the restaurant was shut down. I think
they
replaced the roof of the house where
Sergei and lived.


Yeah I think I remember reading that. The
walls as well, I think.

Yeah
but is that like... Novichok, like
could that
still be found in salisbury, like
on that bench, or in that restaurant or
like...
Would traces of it still be there?


Everything would have been
either decontaminated or decommissioned.
I know
that with other nerve agents when a
military response is called for,
quite often they'll call the bomb
disposal unit and things like that.
For other cases that have been
documented in the uk,
they've actually buried the vehicles
that were used to attend the response.
So I'd imagine...

That's crazy.


Yeah any kind of issue with
contamination
now will have been dealt with, and
everywhere would have been tested to a
sufficient level to be able to say that
it's safe. Yeah I think I read somewhere
that
one of the doctors that were in, I think
it was Sergei's house,
he was in full hazmat and stuff,
but he still had to get rid of
all of his... I think he got rid of all of
his
furniture, they had to move, it was crazy.


Yeah it's a really, really
horrible weapon. 

But that's
why I think that I was so surprised that
they were walking
and spending time outside of the house
for so long before
actually having symptoms. 

I don't know
whether it was confirmed that it was the
door knob,
I know that that was where the highest
dose was found,
or the highest concentration, but whether
that was just
a missed opportunity by the murderers...
Because I don't think it was ever
established where
the initial point of contact was.


Maybe not. I thought it was the doorknob
but
maybe they weren't sure. 

Did I tell you before about one of the times when I
called the police?


Which time? 

Well there was one time when
I was walking
in the south of sweden, I think it was on my
way home or something I don't remember
and there was this girl or woman
who was shouting obscenities
more or less uh sitting on a stoop
outside of a building
and I could see that she was foaming
from the mouth
and I was like: "oh shit that can't be
good".
So another girl walked up to her and
tried to calm her down because she was
very upset,
and I called the police that's the same
number in sweden as like the
hospital, like the emergency vehicles
in general. So I called that number and I
was like: "yeah there's a girl here she's
foaming from the mouth, I don't think
that's good".
So they sent an ambulance. I had never
seen that
before, I think like, it's a very
crazy sight when someone's foaming at
the mouth. You immediately think
something is very wrong here.

I immediately think rabies.


I'm sure... I don't think it was rabies, I
think she was
on drugs unfortunately. 

Well
it could have been nerve agent A234 and
you are just as prejudiced as the police
officers that attended Dawn.


I know right, funny how that works.
Well for the listeners out there, just
so you know, 
I'm not a police officer.
\[Laughter] 

Nice save. 

They would call and I would be like: "where?
Salisbury? That's not a place".


Never heard of it. 

Oh you must've, it's a
wonderful town with the fantastic
cathedral that has this
really old clock... 

Did you know it's
spire reaches 233 and a half
meters? 

I would be like: "is it any
where close to Amesbury?", they were like:
"yeah", and I would be like: "ah
doesn't make any sense, I don't even know".


"Then why did you ask if it was close to
Amesbury?",
"I've got family there", 

"I read it
somewhere on the internet,
that's a place."

"I listened to a really bad
podcast about it."\[laughs]


Okay, do you have your dinner ready now?


It was already about 20 minutes ago. 

I'm
so sorry, I'm gonna let
you eat now. 

How are we gonna close this
wonderful virginial podcast?


This very, very professional podcast? Well
we could just say bye. Bye!
