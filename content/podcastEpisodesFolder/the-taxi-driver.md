Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

Last time we recorded I wanted to tell you about the insect family that we in Sweden call the berry farts. It's a type of bug, it might be a beetle, that we call berry farts. I would say they're probably crawling on berries, a lot of the times like you can find them in berry bushes and stuff like that. If you take them up from the bush they will pee on you or excrement some kind of weird fluid that smells like farts. Do you have that in england? 

No. 

What!?

I don't think you have that in Sweden, I think this is a fever dream. \[Laughter]

\[Music]

Okay, should we start? 

Go for it. 

You're listening to Midweek Murders, which means... No. Fucking shit.

Do you wanna do it... 

Every time. 

Do you wanna do it in a Scottish accent? Can you do it in a Scottish accent?

It's wednesday my dudes, which means that it's time to talk about crime. You're listening to Midweek Murders. I'm your host Willie McBurney and with me is my co-host...

Sandra! Who's Willie McDermott?

Willie McBurney. 

Burney. 

It's the Scottishest name I could think of. \[Laughter]

Okay, that's Joe. You did great man. 

This week we're going to talk about Christopher Halliwell and the two ladies that he murdered.

I would say a five. 

Five?! Fuck off.

On that last bit. Maybe a six.

What? The two... The two ladies that he murdered?

It's the "murdered" that doesn't... 

Listen to a Scottish person say "murdered".

All right. Okay. Yeah, so this week we're going to talk about the murder of Sian O'Callaghan and Becky Godden-Edwards. So I got my information from Wikipedia, BBC News, The Independent by Paul Peachy. I also got references, or information, from A Confession a TV drama. Yes I watched a whole series a couple of weeks before this episode, but I did. And...This is going to be controversial! Controversial! An article in The Sun by Nicola Stowe. And also gov.uk PACE laws, code C - Detention. 

Willie McBurney got his references from a website called judiciary.uk, which was a very informative website that had the recordings of the actual court trials. 

Oooooh! Exciting.

And a BBC article.

So Sian O'Callaghan was at a nightclub in the early hours of the 19th of march 2011. Her boyfriend Kevin texted her at half past three at night. He didn't get a response. When Sian still hadn't arrived home in the morning he called the police and reported her missing, as this was unusual behavior for Sian. The text message Kevin had sent had been received at the Savernake Forest area 12 miles, or 19 kilometers away, but CCTV footage had captured Sian on her way back to their flat in the opposite direction of Savernak Forest at 2.52 and the flat was only 800 meters away. As the forest area was far away from when she can be seen walking towards her home, and the message received 40 minutes after disclosed her location as in the forest, the police determined that she must have been traveling in a vehicle. So the day after her disappearance the police issued a public appeal for any information regarding Sian and announced that they had begun searching the forest area. Approximately 400 civilians joined in on the search. Detective Steve Fulcher told the public on the 23rd that they should stop searching the forest, as the police had zeroed in on a few hotspots, and said that specialist search teams would continue the search on their own. But what was actually happening was that the police had reason to believe that they had found the perpetrator and was hoping that he would lead them to where Sian was being held, or to her body. In the CCTV footage a car can be seen stopping close to where Sian was walking on the sidewalk. The car was a green Toyota Avensis with taxi markings, which could be tracked by CCTV driving towards Savernak Forest. They narrowed down the suspect list by talking to the taxi companies and arrested Christopher Halliwell, a 47 year old taxi driver, at an Asda supermarket parking lot on the 24th of march. They had been surveilling Halliwell for a while in hopes that he would lead them to Sian, to no avail. As they were concerned that he would take his own life after seeing him buy large quantities of paracetamol, they rushed to apprehend him so that he could be brought to justice. When Halliwell wouldn't talk to the arresting police officers, and Steve Fulcher got the news of that, he decided to tell the officers to bring Halliwell to the Iron Age Hill fort to question him himself. Halliwell confessed to the murder of Sian O'Callaghan there and led the police to her body near Uffington in Oxfordshire. Oxfordshire. Did I get it the second time?

Closer. \[Laughter]

What is it? 

Oxfordshire. 

Yeah. I thought that's what I said. \[Laughter] Oxfordshire. Yeah. So after they had been led to Sian's body Halliwell asked Fulcher: "do you want another one?", which led to him confessing to the murder of Becky Godden-Edwards who had been reported missing since 2007. After that, Halliwell led them to the grave. Any notes? 

I have notes on the condition of Sian's body.

Oh yeah? 

And some more detail about the process. 

I'm ready for it. 

The judge in one of his trials, I presume it was the first one, summarized the order of events and said that he'd turned off his taxi handset so that he wouldn't receive any calls and either offered or persuaded Sian a ride home. Took her into the forest where she was assaulted and murdered. And they know that a knife was used, she had stab wounds to her head, and she had bruising and abrasions to her face which were consistent with being kicked. She also had bruising and abrasions to her left breast and nipple, which were consistent with biting or bite marks. So there was clearly sexual motivation involved, it wasn't just a murder lust. And the reason that they found him wasn't due to any forensic linking the first time around. So he was actually really careful in how he deposited any kind of evidence. So Sian was found buried naked, he'd removed all of her clothing. The surveillance team saw him twice take a bunch of cleaning products to the back seat of his car, so he was cleaning out the back of his car. He was also seen depositing a couple of bags into his wheelie bin and when they went and recovered those it was his seat covers and the headrest cover. So he knew that having her in the back of his car would leave a trace. Whether it be hair, or clothing, or anything like that. So he got rid of it all.

I remember him depositing evidence and the surveillance people picking up on that.

Yeah. He also got in his car and drove away through another village

and the surveillance team were obviously

following him and when they passed the

same road that they'd seen him drive

down

they saw a small bonfire on the side of

the road

so he'd obviously taken whatever else he

couldn't throw away

probably sean's clothes and burnt them

in the tv series i watched i think it

was her handbag

but it might not have been i don't know

they obviously couldn't

recover what it was because it was burnt

yeah and then like you said he was seen

on the cctv

which was how they identified his car

yeah so they got an

image analyst who identified the same

car

the same model and the same color and

also noticed that it had

lighter areas on the doors

which were the removable magnetic

stickers

of the taxi company that he worked for

so when they cross referenced that with

all the taxi companies there was pretty

much only one person it could have been

who

ticked all of those boxes i remember in

the tv

series they did say that he had

clocked off the thor doing this so

that's when he turned off his

handset yeah so his last official

drive was before this happened but then

when they questioned him about it

he said that he had gotten home before

this

even happened which obviously wasn't

true

it was a big fat dirty lie yeah so on

the 19th of october

2012 hollywell pleaded guilty to the

murder of

sean but the confessions were ruled

inadmissible because steve vulture was

said to have breached the guidelines

of the police and criminal evidence

act from 1984

by failing to caution Halliwell and

denying him

access to a solicitor vulture hoped that

this

would be allowed as the police are

entitled to carry out

an urgent interview without a solicitor

present if there's a chance to save

somebody's life

even though vulture suspected

sean might have been dead he argued that

the best practice in every case

is to treat it as if there's a chance to

save

somebody's life as they had no evidence

to the contrary if she had been held

hostage at some place he felt like

the pace would allow him to question him

because there was a chance to save her

life

one of the court reportings that i read

actually went into

a lot of detail and had Fulcher's

reasoning behind what he did so to just

go into that

in a little bit more detail when he was

arrested

in the car park he was read his rights

and

cautioned and everything was prim and

proper at that stage

as the supervising officer fulcher

told his colleagues at the car park

conduct the emergency interview an

emergency interview

is basically one where the suspect

doesn't need to be taken back to a

police station

and have their solicitor or lawyer

present

which is the only difference between

that and a normal

interview if you get arrested by the

police you

don't have to answer any of their

questions until they take you to the

police station and you've had a chance

to have legal representation

unless it falls into this emergency

category so basically they stuck him in

the back of a car an unmarked police car

and conducted the emergency interview

and they were instructed to only ask

questions about sean's whereabouts

or her condition so they were just

asking can you tell us where sean is can

you tell us if sean is still alive

during that interview he gave no answers

he either said no comment or that he

didn't know where she was he didn't know

if she was alive

etc etc they relayed all of that

information back

to the supervising officer yeah at that

point

legally the emergency interview was

ended they couldn't continue with it he

should

have been taken to the police station

read his rights again

and been given legal representation the

reason that it becomes

inadmissible in court is because fulcher

had his officers take him like he said

to another location where fulture then

interviewed him again again without

giving him a caution

or reading in his rights and again

refusing

to let him have legal representation

yeah

no i get that and i understood that from

what i read as well from what i

understood

he never stopped investigating

the case as if sean was still alive

yeah and he gave testimony vulture to

say

that the reason he conducted the second

emergency interview

was to stay within the flow

he wanted christopher to feel a bit of

pressure

that they knew they were onto him he

wanted him to give him the answers

as soon as possible and his view like

you said was that

if sean was still alive that was more

important

to him than ticking all of the

legal boxes of the interrogation process

he wanted to make sure if there was a

chance that he could save Sian

that he did it yeah as soon as that

second

interview took place as soon as they

didn't take him to the police station

after that first emergency interview

vulture was in breach of protocol and

that's why it became inadmissible

yeah so what i would like to

amend here for the case is

the pace loss code c the tension

and it's 11.1 what do you call that 11.1

okay so it's eleven point eleven point

don't understand the question

from gov dot uk following a decision to

arrest the suspect

they must not be interviewed about the

relevant

offense except at the police station

or another authorized place of detention

unless the consequent delay would be

likely to a lead

to interference with or harm to

evidence connected with an offense or

interference with or physical harm

to other people or serious loss

of or damage to property

it doesn't excuse the second interview

though no

so in march of 2016

Halliwell was charged with the murder of

becky gordon edwards

becky was a sex worker working in

swinton

so a friend of becky's another sex

worker that had contact with her at the

time

of her death testified at

court that halliwell had been obsessed

with becky

in the tv series she's up on the stand

talking about how he made her

promise that she wouldn't tell becky

that they had sex and he was

representing himself at the time

yeah in the second trial he didn't have

lawyers present

he even cross-examined witnesses and

legally challenged the prosecutor which

i thought was quite funny

becky's friend was like yeah we had sex

and he said

that don't tell becky about this because

he was obsessed

with becky which in the news articles

it said besotted i don't think that's

an accurate description and

in the court hearing it was described as

a repeat customer or something along

those lines

yeah well that's probably more accurate

he was a repeat

customer who thought that he could

control becky

so he was obsessed he was not in love

with becky and the other

sex worker said that he had sex with her

and then yeah

as i said told her to not tell becky

about

them having sex and he was like well

to be honest you're not my type and i

was like

what the is wrong with you dude

obviously he's a murderer and a

huge dick but also like nobody believes

that

nobody believes that he's like oh

you're not my type i would never solicit

your services he is obviously

so the other evidence

was that the police had also found a

shovel

at halliwell's property which had the

same kind of

soil on it as the field had

where becky's body had been buried

becky's mother karen said in a victim

impact statement i never had a body to

kiss goodbye

before she was buried but of course she

had already been buried in a lonely

field

in the middle of nowhere for years just

left to raw and i would like to say

for anyone who's into like true crime

dramas i saw the series and

what's the actor who plays umbridge

email the stormton yeah when they

rang on her door to deliver the news

that becky was dead i cried

and i don't do that to tv i mean

imelda stalton is a fantastic actor you

only have to look at her portrayal of

umbridge as a more hated character than

voldetort to show how well she portrayed

an evil witch yeah that's what i mean

like

she's so good that even i

cried you cry all the time

i don't to tv things i don't

the thing is i don't

i cry on my own time please

and thank you but i don't cry to

tv series and stuff and i cried

when they rang the doorbell to tell her

that her daughter was dead in the tv

series so it's a kind of a good tv

series i wouldn't recommend it to you

but

to the listeners out there a confession

quite good to people who might actually

be interested in true crime

yeah willie mcburney loves to recrime

loves investigating a murder so

after hallie well told a prison

psychiatrist

about a fishing spot that meant a great

deal to him

the police searched the area and found

60 items of women's clothing

discarded in the water two of the

items were linked to hollywell's known

victims

a cardigan worn by becky at the time of

her murder

and the high-heeled boot sean

was wearing when she was abducted did

you read anything about the

clothing items nope

so that was extremely

interesting to me gosh darn it and i

missed out

because i was like oh my god 60

items of clothing and two of them

just one single cardigan that was linked

to becky

because they had evidence of her wearing

it

and one high-heeled boot that shawn was

wearing

at the time of her abduction to me it

means like

there's a lot more victims yeah and

steve fulcher

at the time thought that he would be

leading an

investigation into a serial killer

because he didn't believe that somebody

would kill

someone between 2003 and 2005

and then nothing and then killed someone

else

in 2011. bit of a gap

yeah it is so i find that

disturbing there's just not bode well

no there's a lot of other cases

linked to those geographical

locations and other geographical

locations

that christopher halliwell have been

living at

and this is probably why i feel like

it's fine that he did these

urgent interviews because

if he didn't turn in his notice

at the police station more progress

would have been made in this case yeah i

mean

morally i don't think you can question

him

he was trying to ensure the safety of

sean

and trying to save her i don't think

anybody can doubt that

what he did was in his opinion and

most people's opinion trying to do what

he could to save her

the problem is in most developed

countries

everybody has the right to a fair trial

like i said morally i don't disagree

with what he did

i wouldn't care that a murder suspect

who turns out to have murdered two and

possibly

58 more women or men or people

of any fluid gender i don't care that

he was interviewed without a lawyer i

don't care that he was interviewed

outside of a police station

without being read his right to silence

i couldn't care less this guy

doesn't deserve any of his human rights

because he's taken a life

or multiple but legally is where

it all fell down i think the two judge

reports that i read

they could see exactly that that he

looked to do everything he could to

protect

and serve but legally he didn't dot the

eyes and cross the t's

and therefore anything he brought

forward from those interviews

had to be made inadmissible or the judge

would lose their job

the trial would get thrown out

completely so they'd lose

any chance of prosecution on him how you

all

was convicted of the murders of Sian

becky

and is therefore not eligible

for parole and is serving two life

sentences

so that's good at least i just want to

reiterate so a life sentence in the uk

typically means 25 years

and eligible for parole for good

behavior

so he got the 25 years for

sean's murder yeah and when he was

convicted

for becky's the judge changed it so that

it was a whole life

term with no eligibility for parole so

he now will be behind bars for

the rest of his life so steve fulcher

believes that there are many more

victims

of halliwell as i said before because

he felt like the gap between the murders

is

unusual for murderers who

commit murder for like that kind of

satisfaction which makes sense he wanted

to investigate the murders

of halliwell in more detail

but then he quit the law force because

of the fact that he was prosecuted

because of this case and lost

his whole pension because of it

i just want to point out that it wasn't

a prosecution in the legal sense

no it was an internal policy yeah it

yeah an internal investigation that they

found

he'd made a boo-boo the problem

that i have with this whole case is

the other victims because allegedly

he's probably killed a lot of more

people

the clothes would indicate so yeah i

feel like that as well

because they couldn't identify two of

the pieces of clothing

to his known victims i would

say that the other pieces of clothing

was probably maybe not

all but probably some other victims

and i feel like it's unfair that they

don't

investigate all of the other crimes

that he could have done some answers

would be great you know it would be good

if they

were still investigating it but they

probably

aren't maybe they are expensive in it it

is yeah

what are you gonna do now sleep it's 11

o'clock

oh god are you gonna google berry farts
