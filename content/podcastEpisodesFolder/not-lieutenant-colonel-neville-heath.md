Midweek Murders contains graphic and explicit content, listener discretion is advised.

That's all I had. I've been playing A Hat in Time, it's fun but I'm also shit at it. 

Well it'll feel like any other video game you play then. \[Laughter]

You bastard!

Savage burn.

And this game is all about jumping and I'm not that good at jumping. Not in real life, not in computer games. 

Just spam the buttons like you do with any other game. Hope for the best.

No, you gotta like time it precisely. And not jump too far and not jump too short. And I'm like "aaaaaaaahhhh", fall to my death. 

You'd probably enjoy that.

No, I'm scared of heights. I probably wouldn't.

But death! 

But death is the ultimate prize!

which means that it's time to talk about

crime

you're listening to midweek murders and

i'm your host sandra

and i'm your co-host joe yeah this

is a very horrific crime

and not a lot of forensic science here

we go

this week we're going to talk about

neville heath i quote my information

from

wikipedia the ministry of history dot co

dot uk

and murder uk dot com

i don't remember where i got mine from

our sources

are gonna be on the website midweek

murders

don't neglify the app there we go

we're almost in it now rumors done

listeners

you can go on with your \[ __ ] life

get on with your wednesday

yeah lockdown is getting to us all i

think

so on the 21st of june

19th 25th

the first

you know why because i wrote it as 21.

it's uh that's not right

that's not right on the 21st of june

1946 a 32 year old trained

artist and film extra marjorie gardner

was found dead at the pambridge court

hotel

in a room registered under the name

lieutenant colonel

neville hiss although it's pronounced

lieutenant

oh what did i say oh is that the

american

yes it is

my true colors are showing and i would

appreciate it

if you could pronounce our stolen french

word

in the way we british like to say it the

25th

the 21st the 21st

under the name say it again

lieutenant colonel neville his

although neville his was in fact his

real name

he was not a lieutenant

was it he or was it he's it was all

right

no that was weak

what did i say that was a joke on your

25th

oh okay is it heath or is it east

25th 21st i get it i get it

mine was familiar with the right

no that was weak go home i am home

we're all home it's the \[ __ ] lockdown

that's the problem

\[Laughter]

he was not a lieutenant colonel in fact

neville was a con man

you should edit in some dramatic music

there i think we need to vamp this up to

get more listeners

at age 15 neville had attempted to rape

a girl at a party

fortunately he was stopped by the other

party-goers

as they had heard the girl's cries for

help

the girl's father found him the day

after but

neville managed to talk him out of going

to the police

blaming the incident on a few too many

beers

and here i would like to say that if

someone tries to rape a girl at a party

the beers are not the issue

he failed his school exams and was

forced to take a job

at a textile factory at this point he

realized that men in the military had

higher status

because that's what he was all about

which was why

he decided to join the air force because

being a private

or joining the navy wasn't what he

imagined to be a glamorous lifestyle

as a pilot he changed his accent

to try to fit in with the potter crowd

and lied about having been to eaton

and oxford is even like a private school

for younger people yes where all the

prime ministers go

apart from the lady prime ministers of

which we've only had two

was that at ethan where he \[ __ ] the

pig or was that

somewhere yes oh god oh god

yeah cammy boy we haven't forgotten

cammy he

was then invited to push parties

big \[ __ ] parties which had ultimately

been his goal

but then went awol what that stands for

it's an acronym it's something about

without

without w and o yeah

no i can't remember i know what it is i

can't remember what is it

absent without leave yes that is the one

went absent without leave as he had been

stealing to keep up appearances to fit

in with the posh crowd

after being dismissed from the air force

he kept trying to keep up the act of

being a man of money

he impersonated a lot he also called

himself

lord dudley at some point i don't know

if that's now

or later but dudley is a funny name

to choose is that because you just think

of a fat bully

yeah probably do you know any lord do i

know any lords

it may surprise you to know no i do not

i did not realize that that was a stupid

question

until i've already said it oh

and he impersonated the lord and got in

trouble when he tried buying an

expensive car without having any money

you would say how would he even think

that that

would work but i guess in the 1940s you

could do whatever you wanted

i don't know he was tried for this but

got off easy because he smooth talked

his way out

by claiming to be a young man in over

his head

true story he kind of went to court i

think and then they were like fine

haven't we all got one out of a lawsuit

by just being charming

i was just joshing oh yeah it was just

\[ __ ] a pig you know it was just a

school dare

such a posh accent it's hilarious

he did finally get in real trouble after

selling stolen jewelry to a pawn broker

and got sentenced to three years in a

prison for

juveniles yeah

is that what it's called yeah yeah or as

we like to call it now

in the 21st century juvie yeah

i think i saw it being written as bar

stole

or something like that postal not bar

stool

three years of sitting in the same bars

what a punishment because bastards are

not comfy

oh \[ __ ] up your back a real kid yeah i'd

i'd rather take juvie than

basto he then joined the royal army

service corps because he tried to get

back into the

royal air force they were like no

he was like all right i'll guess i'll

just be a normal

military man then if i have to

a normal military man

in the beginning of world war ii but was

attempted to be shipped home

after less than a year due to stealing

again during which he escaped the guard

throwing a pig at him

\[ __ ] this oh that's got quite a lot of

holes hasn't it jimmy

you occupy yourself with that while

oneself just uh

you know tootle's off down here terry

bye bye

okay he escaped the guard he fled to

south africa

where he pretended to be an aristocrat

and joined the south african air force

where he eventually was given the rank

of captain

captain captain

they're all coming out today yeah during

his time

in the british army he was

court-martialed two

times which i already told you about but

i would like to

reiterate because the south african air

force found out about that

but didn't seem to have been that

bothered about it

at first as neville the giant third boat

talked himself out of that predicament

as well

that wasn't his official title though

was it the giant third boat

i don't think that's a military rank

cut on yeah but then he was

court-martialed

again because he was wearing medals that

wasn't his

and also because of undisciplined

behavior

which must have been bad i'm just gonna

point out that it wasn't that he was

wearing medals that weren't his

he was wearing medals that weren't his

rank

oh yeah oh yeah i just thought i would

simplify it

he's a private in the military and he

just stole jimmy's privates badge

take that jimmy \[ __ ] you jimmy

i'm the private now i'm the private now

ah okay so he was deported from south

africa

after this he returned to war ravaged

britain

in 1946 here

he attempted to rape a young woman who

after being saved by

hotel staff decided not to press charges

as she was afraid of being publicly

shamed

because this was in the 1940s only three

months later is when he murders marjorie

a couple of days before the maid at the

hotel

had discovered the horrific crime scene

neville had checked into the hotel with

his

fiancee in air quotes yvonne

simmons the day after he brutally

assaulted marjorie

neville took a train to meet up with

yvonne again

yvonne had only known neville for a week

and as the murder was all over the

newspapers at the time

neville came up with a story about being

horrified

by being at the same hotel as the crime

had taken place

he also wrote to the police as they had

publicly

announced wanting to speak with him as

his

name had been on the check-in sheet for

the room

i wrote in all caps because i wrote this

whole

thing in a not in a ridge but i would

say in like a

harry potter and the audacity

of this \[ __ ] mode

he wrote in the letter to the police

that he had given his room key

to marjorie and her male companion and

man named jack

even though neville and marjorie had

been seen together the night before

this didn't seem to make neville believe

that he would be suspected

because he was a giant douche canoe do

you have any notes

about the murder only what condition

they found the body in

very horrific i would say trigger

warning

so like you said the chambermaid found

marjorie

she originally couldn't enter the room

so they called

the hotel manager who opened the room

for them

and found marjorie naked in

the bed but covered up to her neck

with the bed sheets once they removed

the bed sheets they found

that her ankles had been bound and there

were

ligation marks on her wrists to show

that her wrists had been bound

as well she had 17 lashes

across her body that seemed to have been

caused by

a diamond headed or shaped

whip of some sort she had savagely

bitten

nipples and an instrument i didn't

manage to find a source that said what

the instrument

was had been inserted into her vagina

and anus and savagely ripped

was one description that was given so

pretty brutal yeah the pathologist

that looked at the case determined her

time of death to be between

midnight and the early morning hours

and the cause of death was given as

suffocation

okay so she was strangled or smothered

okay didn't a coroner say at this point

something along the lines of if you find

that particular type of whip

yes yeah so he said if you find the whip

you find

the culprit basically that was the main

lead

and back in the 40s before forensic

science

existed that was the kind of evidence

that you could take

someone's trial with if you found the

murder weapon

or in this case something so indicative

of being used in the crime

it was basically enough for it to go to

court and to the

jury so yeah that's what the coroner

said if you find the whip

you find the culprit yeah i have a

question later about

that as well okay so after meeting up

with his fiancee

and writing a letter to the police about

marjorie

that would no doubt clear him of any

suspicion

and there i wrote sarcasm neville

traveled to bournemouth

here he checked into the tollered royal

hotel

under the name rupert brooke

i read somewhere

in one of the two sources i mentioned or

three

that rupert brooke was like a poet or

something that had written about

bournemouth

he was definitely a poet okay i don't

know if you wrote about bournemouth

maybe it was from there i don't know i

just found

a bit stupid to use a name

that was a famous name he took the e

off of the end of brook

he was probably fine in terms of being

identified

because they would have just seen the

name well it can't be the famous poet

because there's no e on his name so it

must just be another guy named robert

brooke

he was like let's just take the e oh

bamboozled just reiterates his level of

cunning

this guy yeah of course yeah a genius

is the psychopath of psychopaths really

which is genuinely how he's been

described it's crazy though because he

was \[ __ ] stupid

yeah but he was also a psychopath yeah

and also in the 1940s i guess

you could get away with all kinds of

\[ __ ] oh yeah

no internet back then

they'd have had to go to the library

oh yeah like robert brooke i recognize

that name

traipse all the way to the library ah no

see

different name robert brooke the poet's

got an e on the end can't be the same

guy

so he met a woman in bournemouth named

dorian marshall

who was a 21 year old member of the

women's royal

navy service and had served during

world war ii doreen had gone to

bournemouth to recover from the flu

they met and he introduced himself as a

fellow

like army man which he kind of was i'm

guessing

but military man military man yeah he

probably

put one or two extra you know ranks

there

colonel seconds general admiral

of the grand air navy yeah of course and

then he probably was wearing

some metal private tv ah

jimmy you've been done again keep track

of your \[ __ ] medals jimmy i know

you're only a private but jesus christ

yeah so they had tea together and doreen

accepted neville's invitation to have

dinner

at his hotel yes he did book

a table at his hotel for him and a guest

they were seen walking together towards

the norfolk hotel

after dinner where doreen was staying

the hotel manager at the norfolk hotel

had gotten concerned

as he hadn't seen dorian for two days

after this dinner and contacted the

other hotel

as he knew that that's where durian went

for dinner

when she had been last seen which was

also crazy

but i guess in the 1940s you knew that

kind of \[ __ ]

in the 40s the grand hotels that were

available were more like

a bnb in today's time so they were a lot

more intimate

and you had a chat and stuff with

the manager or the receptionist or

whatever

rather than the budget hotels where

they're like

name room 201 yeah and that's all you

ever speak to anyone about

but it's very lucky and also very good

of the hotel manager to even like

follow up on that well depends on if she

paid for a room in advance

yeah probably that was meant to be a

callous

cold comment that you were supposed to

laugh at not agree with

oh i have no

faith in humanity

sauce so the manager at the tollard

royal hotel

in turn contacted neville to ask if

doreen had been the guest

he had dined with that night because

again

he booked the table at the restaurant

with his name and the guest or not his

name

the poet's name neville denied this

and claimed to have been dining with

some other dame

but in his utter and complete

big-headedness

he agreed to go to the police station to

clear

things up he was not asked to go to the

police station by anyone

he was like i'm gonna go there and you

know

sort things out which is admirable

the audacity again is other

mind-boggling he contacted the police

station

by himself at the police station he

introduced himself as robert brooke and

one

of the police officers thought that he

looked a lot

like the neville heath that had his

photos circulated by the scotland yard

because of his connection with the

murder of marjory gardner

dorian's father and brother had traveled

down to bournemouth

and met neville at the police station by

chance

by trance and was introduced to them

and again this officer that recognized

him from his

photo quite astute i'm glad somebody

looked at the photo that was circular i

mean i've seen a picture

of neville and one

i do not understand the charm

behind him and how he was repeatedly

described as a handsome man

because he's not he's an unattractive

man

secondly he has quite a distinct

face he doesn't look

like he could dissolve into a crowd

like he's got quite distinctive features

so if there's a picture circulating

through all of the police departments

from scotland yard

i'm not surprised at least one police

officer was like you look suspiciously

fugly

i recognize your face that's true and

it's also funny that you mentioned that

he was described as handsome

because on wikipedia the photo they

choose there

i can kind of get it i'm like yeah he

looks alright

and then on the photo on like the other

websites

when is in the car smoking his pipe no

have you seen that one

no that is not a good look no and the

other

photos he looks not at all handsome

i don't it looks okay you carry on i'm

gonna google a picture and send it to

you

of what it reminds me of and the photo

will be up on the website

if it's not a celebrity because then

probably not

yeah so neville asked to get his jacket

from the hotel

and detective inspector george gates

went to the hotel to fetch it as he was

suspicious about

neville probably because he looked like

the photo of neville his

in the jacket they found a pearl from

doreen's necklace

as well as her return train ticket they

also found a cloakroom ticket

and went to the train station to check

what

else neville might have stored and there

they hit the proverbial jackpot in a

suitcase

with bloodstained items the blood coming

from marjory

and items with tags clearly spelling out

the name his

they also recovered from the suitcase

the riding crop

with the same cross weave as the one

used on marjorie

and this is where i have the question

for you

because they said that the bloodstained

items could be linked to margaery

how did they link that in the 1940s so

they would have detected

what blood type the blood spatter was

whether it was

a o a positive a b

whatever all of the options are and then

would have compared that

to margaery's blood type before dna

fingerprinting came in which was

colin pitchfork which we've already

discussed

way way back blood typing was the only

way to get

a match as it were so it's not really a

match because obviously it could be

anyone of the same blood type but given

the

extenuating circumstances which was also

the riding crop yeah it proved enough in

the 40s to

lead to the conviction yeah i don't know

why i was surprised

it's really really simple to determine

blood type

you can do it at home with the right kit

yeah and i also

realized that obviously during the war i

obviously knew

what blood types the soldiers were and

could like do blood transfusions and

\[ __ ]

i didn't even remember that i don't know

it just seems like so

far back but it wasn't it was 80 years

ago now

but i think because science moves so

quickly in our generation

it can sometimes be hard to track back

to what stage

they were at in history because really

that kind of thing and fingerprinting

and dna

fingerprinting and genome sequencing has

only really

come through in the last 20 30 years

so when you go all the way back to 80

their science seems quite primitive

but it could have been cutting edge at

the time yeah and also i'm guessing

this might be a yucky question but i'm

guessing the crush

i've got a degree in forensic science i

think any yucky question is

probably gonna be fine

i'm guessing that the crossweave could

be

like traced to the riding crop because

of the lacerations

like they could see the crossfield

pattern yeah so

an easier to imagine example of a boot

print

in mud yeah the tread will match the

imprint

in the mud and that's basically what

they would have done with the riding

crop

is match the pattern and the size

because it's not a nine tails

if you know what that is yeah yeah so

you wouldn't have had multiple threads

like

cross contaminating i think is probably

the best way to describe it so if you

strike with the nine tails

yeah some of those tails could overlap

and then wipe out the pattern but

because with a riding crop

each strike has to be individual unless

he's hitting over the same

place yeah which he wasn't because they

counted

17 hits it would have been manageable

to cross-reference the pattern that was

left on marjorie with the riding crop

which is why the coroner was so sure if

you find the crop you find

the culprit yeah yeah so neville's gig

was up

and he was taken to london

to stand trial for the murder of

marjorie gardner

the police in bournemouth realized that

doreen marshall had likely been murdered

by the same man

because he was at the police station

talking to them

about dorian marshall the day after

dorian's badly mutilated body was found

by a woman

walking her dog and that is like she

found

a suspicious swarm of flies by a

rhododendron

bush and then she went home and fetched

her dad

and was like okay there might be a body

or something here

we should check it out which i would say

that woman very astute well a lot of

murder victims are found by dog walkers

yeah yeah but also in the 1940s she was

like a swarm of flies

i could be something suspicious like

swarm of flies in the middle of summer

you must come down to the rhododendron

gather my girdle and meet me at the

rhododendrons

yeah okay so on a very awful note

you had some things about the body yes

so like you said they found doreen in

the road engines

she had clear defense wounds

on her hands so she was

conscious and fighting when she was

abducted again the clothing was removed

much like they found margaery and

the body showed that there was a clear

blow to the head

her wrists and ankles were bound so the

same

ammo as marjorie again and one of her

nipples was bitten

off so he went a bit further than he

went with margaery

escalating behavior yeah yeah and again

an instrument which one source said

was a tree branch but unconfirmed

by other sources had been inserted

into her vagina and anus the cause of

death

this time was two slashes or cuts to her

throat

so if he severed her carotid

then hopefully she'd have died quite

quickly and painlessly

so a different method of murder

but similar enough between marjorie and

doreen

for the police to be comfortable i'd say

rather than confident

that it was probably the same person

yeah i have a question did they find the

knife

not as far as i'm aware okay okay so

i read that one of the reasons for why

he was convicted

of murder and not like deemed insane and

stuff

was that they said that they could prove

that he had pre-planned it because

apparently and this might not be true

but apparently had

taken his clothes off before murdering

her

and then washed off like his hands and

stuff in the sea

and then put his clothes back on did you

read about that

i didn't read anything about that but

there is a

a level of premeditation in the fact

that he had a knife

in doreen's murder yeah that's true yeah

i think her stuff was also found like a

big shot

or something or some of her stuff i

don't remember

the exactly i think it's interesting

that there was probably more

more evidence to use in the case of him

being sane and pre-meditating

for doreen's murder and yet that wasn't

the one he was tried for

yeah yeah that's true because i also

read that

that he was actually hanged for

marjorie's murder yeah

he was only tried for marjorie's murder

so doreen's murder didn't

even make it to the core oh because

it happened too quickly he was shipped

off to london

after they found the things like the

riding crop and stuff

yeah quite possibly the whole court

proceeding was very quick it only took

the jury an

hour to come to the conclusion that he

was guilty

so yeah it was probably the enough

evidence was available to prosecute him

for

marjorie yeah yeah that they didn't even

stall it

long enough to convict for doreen as

well

yeah which is a bit sad really for a

family yeah

but i guess if they were confident that

it was him then

he's gone now so yeah that's true i

think

that i also read that he said he claimed

because he did confess to marjorie's

murder and said that he

blacked out drunk and then woke up and

had murdered her i'm like 100 percent

not that kind of abuse and like

assault doesn't happen if somebody's so

drunk they can't remember or stand up

like it's

yeah and that was that was exactly how

it was counted

in court as well they just said that's

complete nonsense

the amount of premeditation and planning

and forethought and awareness

to inflict this amount of damage to two

bodies

or even one body at the time because

they were only looking at margaery

there's no way that anybody could do

this if they were blackout drunk

yeah i think he was hoping that maybe

eyewitnesses would corroborate

that he was drunk because eyewitnesses

did come forward and say

that margaery and neville were well into

their cups

and was staggering back to the hotel but

i think the prosecution lawyers did a

good enough job to convince the jury

that just the sheer amount of malice

yeah that was inflicted on her body

couldn't have been done by someone who

wasn't in control of their faculties

no definitely impossible he could have

also like as you said

faked it to maybe lure marjorie and

and maybe get eyewitnesses to say that

he was drunk

but yeah i think he's full of \[ __ ]

well not anymore he died he did

yeah so neville he was found guilty

and was not deemed insane as the defense

argued as we said

the doctors like the psychologist

that had interviewed him in prison found

him to be a psychopath

and a sexual siddist but not insane

or like in any kind of psychotic episode

i don't know if he read this but he

managed to get

a either psychiatrist or psychologist i

can't remember

to vouch for him in court and that was

where the plead of

insanity came from he was like yeah we

can do that

no problem and then all of the evidence

that this

expert shall we call him provided

was thrown out because they found he was

a heroin addict

what the doctor or the psychiatrist the

psychologist or the psychiatrist

went to court and obviously defended

neville

to whatever extent a supposedly

impartial

expert witness could defend and they

were like oh

yeah that's interesting oh that might be

true hold on a minute this guy's

high off his tits really and then they

got

the two psychologists that evaluated

neville in prison yeah and they both

offered contradictory no this guy is

had a child

include their names because i feel like

that child because they haven't got a

daddy or because

still feel that's exactly how

genes work that child is gonna grow up

half a psychopath you better hope his

mother was a saint
